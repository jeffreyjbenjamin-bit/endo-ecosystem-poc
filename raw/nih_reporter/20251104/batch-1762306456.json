or proliferative breast lesions has been shown to offer a unique approach to breast cancer prevention. Vaccines can elicit memory Tcells\nthat remain in lymph nodes until exposed to the target antigen. Upon stimulation, T-cells migrate to the site of antigen expressing lesions and will proliferate and destroy those lesions.\nHER-2/neu (HER2), insulin like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), and insulin like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF1R) are overexpressed across all subtypes of DCIS, involved in its\ninitiation and progression to invasive breast cancer, and are associated with poor prognosis. These proteins have also been shown to be immunogenic, i.e. elicit both humoral and cellular\nimmune responses in breast cancer patients. A multi-antigen multi-peptide vaccine targeting these proteins was shown to be effective in suppressing the development of palpable lesions and slowing tumor growth in preclinical models of HER2+ and HER2- breast cancers, TgMMTV-neu and TgC3(I)-Tag, respectively. Interestingly, concurrent vaccination and oral administration of a retinoic X receptor (RXR) agonist, bexarotene, significantly improved disease-free survival in TgMMTV-neu mice, suggesting that the RXR agonist bexarotene enhanced protective immunity in vaccinated mice. Subsequently, the multi-antigen multipoeptide vaccine targeting the three antigens, HER2-IGFBP2-IGF1R, has been reformulated to a DNA vaccine platform termed WOKVAC. A clinical trial is currently underway to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the WOKVAC in women with locally advanced non-metastatic HER2 negative breast (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02780401).  Retinoids comprise a group of compounds related to vitamin A, including its natural and synthetic analogues. These are biochemically converted to retinoic acid (RA) that binds to its cognate nuclear receptors, RAR (retinoic acid receptor) and RXR (retinoic X receptor) to regulate gene transcription. RARs and RXRs are nuclear receptors that function as transcription factors, regulating cell growth, cell differentiation, cell survival and death pathways. \nRXR-selective agonists, Rexinoids bind to RXR but not to RAR. The ability of these agents to activate multiple cellular pathways, and the ubiquitous expression of RXR make them interesting therapeutic molecules. There has been significant interest in this class of compounds in cancer therapy as evidenced by anticancer activity of the RXR agonist bexarotene (Targretin), which is approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. These agents have shown anti-tumor efficacy in a variety of rodent models of mammary and lung cancers. However, the elevation of triglyceride levels associated with bexarotene and other analogs such as 9-cis-retinoic acid, UAB76 and UAB11 is a major concern particularly in the cancer prevention setting, where high-risk but relatively healthy individuals may have to be treated for a prolonged period of time. Significant efforts have been made to develop RXR agonists that promote beneficial effects in pre-neoplastic tissues with little or no lipid toxicity. One such\ncompound is 9-cis-UAB30 (UAB30). In preclinical studies, oral dosing of UAB30 was shown not to induce triglyceride accumulation in sera of female rodents, while oral administration of bexarotene substantially enhanced serum lipid levels, suggesting that UAB30 avoids the major dose-limiting toxicity of bexarotene and be useful in long-term chronic dosing. Extensive preclinical studies have also been conducted, demonstrating that UAB30 is not mutagenic. A Phase 0 dose escalation study conducted in healthy volunteers demonstrated that UAB30 has favorable pharmacology as an oral agent. A double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 1 study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of UAB30 in human after 28days of chronic dosing is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01935960).\nAs noted above, a recent study by Disis et al has demonstrated that the combination of the RXR agonist bexarotene with the multi-antigen multi-peptide vaccine targeting HER2, IGFBP-2 and IGF-1R is more effective than either agent alone in preventing the development of invasive breast cancer in a transgenic mouse mammary tumor model. Bexarotene on its own increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells to a level comparable to what was seen in animals receiving vaccine alone. These data suggest that the immune stimulation may be a significant contributor to the efficacy of bexarotene observed in breast cancer model, and may synergize with the vaccine to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy. There is also evidence to indicate that treatment with Rexinoids have important immunomodulating effects on T cells, e.g. augmenting interleukin-2 receptor expression by activated T cells and preventing activation-induced cell death, a process T cells undergo when exposed to chronic amounts of cancer associated antigens. Furthermore, retinoic acid has been shown to play a key role in immune homeostasis, has a role in balancing Th17 and regulatory T cells, and is also essential for proper T helper cell responses. Interestingly, vitamin A has been recognized as an essential nutrient for the proper function of the immune system for nearly 100 years. Therefore, chemo-immunoprevention strategies such as combination of RXR agonists and cancer vaccines may be a rational approach to breast cancer prevention when the vaccine is administrated in the presence of subclinical disease. Considering the low toxicity profile and tolerability, UAB30 may be more desirable than bexarotene in the combination study with WOKVAC to gain well-tolerated and long lasting anti-tumor response in treating DCIS and preventing invasive breast cancer.", "project_title": "Evaluating Whether a Concurrent Retinoid X Receptor Agonist can Enhance the Efficacy of the HER2-IGFPB2-IGF1R Vaccine in

Summary / Abstract\n Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects\nover 5.8 million people in the US alone. Individuals who carry the apolipoprotein E-ε4 (APOE4) gene are at\nheightened risk for developing late onset AD. Project 2 of the proposed P01 renewal “Vascular Contributions to\nDementia and Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease” will provide critical advances towards discovering\nhow changes in brain connectivity, structure and function relate to neurovascular and blood-brain barrier (BBB)\nintegrity and ultimately confer cognitive impairment in APOE4 carriers (e3/e4, e4/e4) relative to APOE3\nhomozygotes (e3/e3).\n Project 2 will follow 402 APOE4 carriers and 465 APOE3 homozygotes, initially enrolled as CU (75%)\nand MCI (25%) at baseline, who will continue to be evaluated longitudinally for changes in brain connectivity in\nrelation to neurovascular and cognitive function. Participants will continue to receive the same imaging protocol\nto enable longitudinal analyses, including 1) multi-shell DTI for white matter connectivity; 2) resting fMRI for\nfunctional connectivity; 3) structural MRI for gray matter shape, volume; and 4) DCE-MRI for BBB integrity\n(Project 1), as well as BBB/neurovascular unit (NVU) biofluid biomarkers (Core B). For preclinical AD staging,\nwe will follow the AT(N) biomarkers framework. For cognitive assessment, we will use the UDS 3.0 cognitive\ntests and supplemental tests across different cognitive domains to evaluate the relationships between\nneurovascular/BBB dysfunction and biomarkers, structural and functional connectivity, and cognitive function\nfollowing the AT(N) research framework.

One of the\nreasons why center-based programs like Head Start and state-funded prekindergarten may be effective and of high quality is because of the use of curricula, which guide interactions and activities in the classroom. However, the literature has not sufficiently provided evidence of features of specific curricular packages that attend to all facets of children's development and meet the needs of children with different backgrounds.\nThis mixed-methods study addresses an important topic of interest to the Administration for Children and Families, the Child Care Development Fund, and the Office of Head Start: curriculum as a key feature of high-quality center-based care and education for young children. Specifically, the study seeks to understand the influence of various preschool curricula on children's school readiness skills, for whom they work best, and how they are implemented in the classroom by answering: (1) Are commonly used preschool curricula packages differentially related to children's school readiness skills? (2) What is the effect of academically targeted curricula on the distribution of children's academic achievement? (3) How do teachers implement the same curriculum across classrooms and how might they adapt the curriculum to address children's diverse needs?\nTo address the research questions, quantitative analysis of two national datasets (Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey 2009 Cohort and Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Initiative Study) containing rich data on child care, curricula use, and school readiness outcomes will be analyzed. I will investigate whether curricular packages are related to children's school readiness outcomes and whether the treatment effects of some packages vary along the distribution of children's outcomes. This will be followed by a qualitative study in which I conduct observations in local Orange County, California Head Start centers to better understand whether the heterogeneity of implementation by teachers using the same curriculum contributes to variation in its effects.\nThe results of this study will further the field's understanding of curriculum as an important feature in center-based care, both nationally and locally, and has implications for promoting school readiness skills for linguistically and culturally diverse low-income and disadvantaged children. Further, understanding variation in curricula effects is critical for facilitating the most efficient use of limited resources, by informing decisions about how best to targeted specific curricular programs, and suggesting ways to improve the design or implementation of the programs for center-based child care settings.

FSH) are present\nin the Sertoli cells of testis and granulosa cells of ovaries. FSH is essential for normal high quality\ngametogenesis in males and females. Glycoprotein hormones which function in fertility and normal\nthyroid function are of general medical significance. Function of the FSH receptor (FSHR) beyond\nthe initial binding event is regulated by cytoplasmic proteins which bind to receptor intracellular loops\n(il_) and regulate receptor function and act to organize receptors. Adapter proteins that have been\nidentified which interact with human FSHR (hFSHR) are the focus of these studies. Aim one is to\nstudy the role of newly discovered adapter proteins APPL 1 and 2, that bind to FSHR-iLL Using\nsiRNA to inhibit their synthesis in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells, the role of APPL1 and\nAPPL2 regulation in FSH driven granulosa cell functions will be determined. In addition, amino acids\nin FSHR-IL1 which are essential for interaction with APPL proteins will be determined so that binding\ndefective mutants can be studied for trafficking defects. Aim two will study the adapter protein 14-3-\n3 tau which binds to FSHR-iL.2. It will be determined how inhibition of 14-3-3 tau affects FSHR\nsignal transduction pathways in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells. Mutants ofhFSHR-il_2\ndefective in binding to 14-3-3 tau will be prepared and FSH activation of the Erk pathway will be\nstudied in rat granulosa cell lines expressing these FSHR mutants. The third aim will determine the\nfunctional significance of the protein kinase CK2 (PKCK2) consensus site of thehFSHR-il_3.\nConsequences of inhibition of PKCK2 on steroidogenesis in primary cultures of human granulosa\ncells will be studied. It will be determined if PKCK2 interacts with hFSHR-il_3,and if consensus site\nmutants of the receptor are ubiquitination defective. Phosphorylation of hFSHR by PKCK2 will also\nbe studied.

(follitropin; FSH) are present\nin the Sertoli cells of testis and granulosa cells of ovaries. FSH is essential for normal high quality\ngametogenesis in males and females. Glycoprotein hormones which function in fertility and normal\nthyroid function are of general medical significance. Function of the FSH receptor (FSHR) beyond\nthe initial binding event is regulated by cytoplasmic proteins which bind to receptor intracellular loops\n(il_) and regulate receptor function and act to organize receptors.

Aim one is to\nstudy the role of newly discovered adapter proteins APPL 1 and 2, that bind to FSHR-iLL Using\nsiRNA to inhibit their synthesis in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells, the role of APPL1 and\nAPPL2 regulation in FSH driven granulosa cell functions will be determined. In addition, amino acids\nin FSHR-IL1 which are essential for interaction with APPL proteins will be determined so that binding\ndefective mutants can be studied for trafficking defects. Aim two will study the adapter protein 14-3-\n3 tau which binds to FSHR-iL.2. It will be determined how inhibition of 14-3-3 tau affects FSHR\nsignal transduction pathways in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells.

The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue\nand heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid\nobesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to\ndevelopment of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some\nforms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways\nand molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that\nembodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including “browning” of subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis\nof skeletal muscles.\nIn bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via αv integrins, with αvβ5 identified as the major receptor.\nHowever, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and αvβ5\nsuggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of\nirisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor\nbinding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates\nirisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an\nexercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90α binds to integrin αvβ5, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the\nbinding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in\nthat irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a\nnon-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.\nBiophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and\nglycosylation mutants), αvβ5 and Hsp90α. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells\nectopically expressing αv and β5, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. The effects of Hsp90α will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance\nour understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug\nand antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular\ndegenerative disorders.\nThe proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in\nwhich I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary\ntechnologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce’s networks, DFCI and HMS,\ntremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.", "project_title": "Elucidating novel molecular mechanisms of irisin-mediated effects via integrin", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE:\nInactive lifestyle leads to a variety of diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular dysfunctions, and\nmental illness, and the sedentary behavior caused by diseases exacerbates pathogenesis.

SUMMARY\nObesity and its associated type II diabetes have reached worldwide epidemic. Exercise training is a robust means\nto increase energy expenditure and downregulate chronic inflammation, and serves as an excellent primary\nintervention to combat obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Exercise mediates an increase in the\ncirculating levels of certain hormones released from muscle that mediate certain exercise-induced adaptations\nof the body. Irisin is the first polypeptide molecule identified from the exercised muscle: irisin stimulates several\nadaptations, including the “beiging” of white adipose tissue, bone remodeling, and improvement of cognition and\nmotor function in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In collaboration with the Diane Mathis lab, we identified\na specific immune pathway—the IL33-ST2 pathway— that is regulated by irisin to modulate adipose\ninflammation, in inguinal fat tissue (iWAT) and also in visceral fat tissue (eWAT). The molecular basis of irisin\nactions has been elaborated in my recent published work: (1) irisin collaborates with Hsp90α, another\nextracellular proteinthat activates integrin structure to allow high-affinity binding; (2) Hsp90α itself is induced with\nexercise in mice; (3) irisin binds to a face that is distinct from the docking sites of the classical integrin ligands,\nimplying that this surface can be targeted by agonists without interfering with canonical integrin functions. My\ncurrent research plan is devised to (i) test our molecular mechanistic model in the context of adipose-immune\ncross talk (Aim 1); (ii) further dissect the downstream immune response pathways that respond to irisin action\n(Aim 2), (iii) understand how the irisin-mediated immune pathway regulates different thermogenic programs\n(Aim 2), and (iv) identify other “irisin-style” hormone molecules that serve a protective role in metabolic diseases\nsuch as diabetes (Aim 3), a discovery-based study planned to pave the road to my first R01. Collectively, this\nwork will contribute to fundamental knowledge of integrin biology as well as to the development of therapeutics\nfor treating metabolic disorders and beyond.\n Integrins are a large receptor family that is well known for mediating cell adhesion. Irisin is the first known\nhormone ligand that uses integrin as its receptor in a noncanonical manner, to convey pleiotropic effects - such\nas induction of IL33 expression in adipose stromal cells - that cannot be triggered by canonical integrin ligands.\nUncovering the cellular signaling pathways that are specifically activated by irisin will greatly expand our\nknowledge of integrin cellular function, and the kinases and other key players in these novel pathways will serve\nas new targets for tissue-level immune regulation and drug development. This proposal will allow me to\nundertake mechanistic studies at different levels, and from different angles. Armed with my previous training in\nbiochemistry and molecular metabolism and supported by two strong mentors in the immunometabolism field\nand six contributors that have all necessary expertise required to complete my proposed experiments, I envision\nno insurmountable obstacles in fulfilling the proposed projects and in transitioning to independence.", "project_title": "The mechanistic study on irisin-mediated immune response and its role in adipose tissue dynamics", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nExercise benefits the body in multiple ways - and irisin, one of the exercise-induced hormones from muscle,\nrecapitulates several aspects of these benefits, including the induction of heat generation from white fat tissue,\nstrengthening bones, and improving brain functions such as memory and brain-directed movements.

The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue\nand heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid\nobesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to\ndevelopment of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some\nforms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways\nand molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that\nembodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including “browning” of subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis\nof skeletal muscles.\nIn bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via αv integrins, with αvβ5 identified as the major receptor.\nHowever, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and αvβ5\nsuggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of\nirisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor\nbinding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates\nirisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an\nexercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90α binds to integrin αvβ5, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the\nbinding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in\nthat irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a\nnon-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.\nBiophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and\nglycosylation mutants), αvβ5 and Hsp90α. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells\nectopically expressing αv and β5, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. The effects of Hsp90α will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance\nour understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug\nand antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular\ndegenerative disorders.\nThe proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in\nwhich I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary\ntechnologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce’s networks, DFCI and HMS,\ntremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.", "project_title": "Elucidating novel molecular mechanisms of irisin-mediated effects via integrin", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE:\nInactive lifestyle leads to a variety of diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular dysfunctions, and\nmental illness, and the sedentary behavior caused by diseases exacerbates pathogenesis.

The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue\nand heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid\nobesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to\ndevelopment of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some\nforms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways\nand molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that\nembodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including “browning” of subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis\nof skeletal muscles.\nIn bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via αv integrins, with αvβ5 identified as the major receptor.\nHowever, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and αvβ5\nsuggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of\nirisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor\nbinding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates\nirisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an\nexercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90α binds to integrin αvβ5, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the\nbinding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in\nthat irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a\nnon-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.\nBiophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and\nglycosylation mutants), αvβ5 and Hsp90α. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells\nectopically expressing αv and β5, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. The effects of Hsp90α will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance\nour understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug\nand antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular\ndegenerative disorders.\nThe proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in\nwhich I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary\ntechnologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce’s networks, DFCI and HMS,\ntremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.", "project_title": "Elucidating novel molecular mechanisms of irisin-mediated effects via integrin", "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE:\nInactive lifestyle leads to a variety of diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular dysfunctions, and\nmental illness, and the sedentary behavior caused by diseases exacerbates pathogenesis.

Influx of serum components into the\ncentral nervous system could compromise neuronal function by altering the\nmicro-environment.  HIV-infected individuals have systemic abnormalities,\nsuch as immune activation and elevated cytokine levels, that could alter\nthe BBB and produce neuronal dysfunction and eventual neuronal death.\nThe overall objective of this study is to determine the contribution of\naltered BBB to the progression of neurological diseases associated with\nHIV infection.  Specific Aim 1 will define the extent of BBB damage\nduring HIV  infection and correlate this damage with the clinical and\nimmunological status of the patient.  If alterations in the BBB\ncontribute to neurologic disease in HIV-infected individuals, such\ndisease may be prevented or delayed by therapies that prevent BBB damage.\nTherefore, the studies in Specific aims 2-4 will define changes in\nendothelial cells and perivascular macrophages that contribute to BBB\ndysfunction, whereas Specific Aim 5 will characterize alterations in\nneurons.\n\nPreliminary studies indicate that production of nitric oxide (NO) is\nupregulated in endothelial cells of HIV-infected brains.  Endothelial NO\nis a vasodilator and toxin that can alter the permeability of the BBB.\nBecause NO is difficult to measure, NO synthesizing cells will be\nidentified by localizing the NO metabolizing enzyme, nitric oxide\nsynthase (NOS).  At least four different forms of NOS are present in\nbrain.  Specific Aim 2 will determine the distribution and quantity of\nthese different NOS molecules in HIV-infected brains.  We will determine\nif increases in NOS expression correlate with alterations in the BBB or\nwith dementia.\n\nSpecific Aim 3 of this proposal will characterize the expression of\nadhesion molecules by endothelial cells in HIV-infected brains.  It is\nanticipated that endothelial cells will alter the expression of genes\nthat are known to be inducible or to respond to pathological conditions.\nWe will determine if the expression of ICAM, VCAM, and ELAM on\nendothelial cells is related to breakdown of the BBB or dementia.  These\nadhesion molecules can bind monocytes and they may facilitate the entry\nof perivascular macrophages into HIV-infected brain.  Specific Aim 4 will\nfocus on the characterization of perivascular macrophages in HIV-infected\nbrain.  We will determine whether the numbers of these cells are\nincreased in HIV infection and whether their increase correlates with\nalterations in the BBB or with dementia.  In addition, we will determine\nwhat percentage of perivascular macrophages express detectible levels of\nHIV protein and cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.  It is\nanticipated that alterations in endothelial cells will precede\nneurological dysfunction and detectible changes in the BBB.

perturbation or bacterial contamination and initiate\ninflammation during microbial defense or inflammatory diseases. The NLRC4 inflammasome detects the\nactivity of bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SS) as well as flagellin, and then activates caspase-1, which\nprocesses IL-1 and IL-18 to their mature forms, and initiates a form of programmed lytic cell death called\npyroptosis to prevent the establishment of an intracellular replication niche. Caspase-11, the non-canonical\ninflammasome, detects LPS in the cytosol and triggers pyroptosis, but cannot process pro-IL-1 or IL-18 alone.\nUsing Burkholderia thailandensis, a model for the cytosol invasive select agent Burkholderia pseudomallei, I\nfound that B. thailandensis is primarily cleared via caspase-11, while caspase-1 plays a minor role in defense.\nSpecifically, I found that caspase-1 activation by the T3SS provides a priming signal, IL-18-induced IFN-,\nupstream of caspase-11 expression during defense against B. thailandensis, leading to clearance in 24 hours.\nBy contrast, in the absence of caspase-1-driven IL-18, bacterial burdens persist for several days, eventually\ntriggering other signals that induce IFN- and downstream caspase-11 expression. In this proposal, I will\ninvestigate why caspase-1 and -11 dependent pyroptosis are not equivalent, and what is the cellular source of\nIFN-γ that prime caspase-11 to protect against B.thailandensis. These studies will provide new insights into the\nmechanisms behind inflammasome-mediated defense against infection, and thus aid future treatments aimed\nat therapeutic manipulation of the host innate immune system.", "project_title": "Mechanisms of Inflammasome Defense against Cytosol-invasive Bacteria", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nThe experiments in this proposal focus on the inflammasome, an innate immune system signaling mechanism\nthat regulates inflammation during infection and inflammatory diseases.

Yet, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent shigellosis. Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo.

Yet, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent shigellosis. Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo.

perturbation or bacterial contamination and initiate\ninflammation during microbial defense or inflammatory diseases. The NLRC4 inflammasome detects the\nactivity of bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SS) as well as flagellin, and then activates caspase-1, which\nprocesses IL-1β and IL-18 to their mature forms, and initiates a form of programmed lytic cell death called\npyroptosis to prevent the establishment of an intracellular replication niche. Caspase-11, the non-canonical\ninflammasome, detects LPS in the cytosol and triggers pyroptosis, but cannot process pro-IL-1β or IL-18 alone.\nUsing Burkholderia thailandensis, a model for the cytosol invasive select agent Burkholderia pseudomallei, I\nfound that B. thailandensis is primarily cleared via caspase-11, while caspase-1 plays a minor role in defense.\nSpecifically, I found that caspase-1 activation by the T3SS provides a priming signal, IL-18-induced IFN-γ,\nupstream of caspase-11 expression during defense against B. thailandensis, leading to clearance in 24 hours.\nBy contrast, in the absence of caspase-1-driven IL-18, bacterial burdens persist for several days, eventually\ntriggering other signals that induce IFN-γ and downstream caspase-11 expression. In this proposal, I will\ninvestigate why caspase-1 and -11 dependent pyroptosis are not equivalent, and what is the cellular source of\nIFN-γ that prime caspase-11 to protect against B.thailandensis.

When \nactivated by sensors that detect pathological bacterial activity, caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL- \n18 to their mature and secreted forms to recruit additional immune cells. In addition, caspase-1 also \ntriggers a lytic form of programmed cell death called pyroptosis. In contrast, caspase-11 induces \npyroptosis, but cannot process pro-IL-1β or IL-18 alone. \nNeutrophils are a major cell type recruited to early sites of infection. However, whether neutrophils also \nexpress inflammatory caspases in order to detect bacterial virulence remains unclear. Intriguingly, \nneutrophils express numerous pattern recognition receptors and sensors upstream of caspases, but their \nfunction in infection has not been thoroughly studied. \nGiven the importance of inflammasomes in macrophages, and the importance of neutrophils in \nsterilizing infection, it is likely that neutrophils also use inflammasomes to tune their responses to infection. \nIndeed, we found that neutrophil caspase-11 is activated and clears infected neutrophils with extreme \nefficiency. Thus, in this grant, we propose to compare and contrast the inflammasome signaling pathways \nin neutrophils and macrophages, and determine the role of inflammasome in each cellular compartment \nduring defense against intracellular and extracellular infection. Determining the role of inflammasomes in \nneutrophils may provide new perspectives about the function of neutrophils during infection, as well as \ninsight into potentially novel and innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing cytosolic infection in \nneutrophils.", "project_title": "Study of the Cell-specific Inflammasome Responses During Defense Against Gram-negative Bacteria",

cells to detect bacterial contamination of a tissue, and use \ninflammatory caspases such as caspases-1 and -11 to distinguish virulent from avirulent bacteria. When \nactivated by sensors that detect pathological bacterial activity, caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL- \n18 to their mature and secreted forms to recruit additional immune cells. In addition, caspase-1 also \ntriggers a lytic form of programmed cell death called pyroptosis. In contrast, caspase-11 induces \npyroptosis, but cannot process pro-IL-1β or IL-18 alone. \nNeutrophils are a major cell type recruited to early sites of infection. However, whether neutrophils also \nexpress inflammatory caspases in order to detect bacterial virulence remains unclear. Intriguingly, \nneutrophils express numerous pattern recognition receptors and sensors upstream of caspases, but their \nfunction in infection has not been thoroughly studied. \nGiven the importance of inflammasomes in macrophages, and the importance of neutrophils in \nsterilizing infection, it is likely that neutrophils also use inflammasomes to tune their responses to infection. \nIndeed, we found that neutrophil caspase-11 is activated and clears infected neutrophils with extreme \nefficiency. Thus, in this grant, we propose to compare and contrast the inflammasome signaling pathways \nin neutrophils and macrophages, and determine the role of inflammasome in each cellular compartment \nduring defense against intracellular and extracellular infection. Determining the role of inflammasomes in \nneutrophils may provide new perspectives about the function of neutrophils during infection, as well as \ninsight into potentially novel and innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing cytosolic infection in \nneutrophils.", "project_title": "Study of the Cell-specific Inflammasome Responses During Defense Against Gram-negative Bacteria", "phr_text": null, "spending_categories_desc": null, "agency_code": "NIH", "covid_response": null, "arra_funded": "N", "budget_start": "2020-05-01T00:00:00", "budget_end": "2021-04-30T00:00:00", "cfda_code": null, "funding_mechanism": "Research Centers", "direct_cost_amt": 168639, "indirect_cost_amt": 82152, "project_detail_url": "https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10161251", "date_added": "2020-07-25T19:39:36"}, {"appl_id": 10836918, "subproject_id": null, "fiscal_year": 2024, "project_num": "1U01FD008130-01", "project_serial_num": "FD008130", "organization": {"org_name": "DELIBERATE SOLUTIONS, INC.", "city": null, "country": null, "org_city": "NEW YORK", "org_country": "UNITED STATES", "org_state": "NY", "org_state_name": null, "dept_type": null, "fips_country_code": null, "org_duns": ["117419307"], "org_ueis": ["JEAGCLNNLEA7"], "primary_duns": "117419307", "primary_uei": "JEAGCLNNLEA7", "org_fips": "US", "org_ipf_code": "10060421", "org_zipcode": "100284004", "external_org_id": 10060421}, "award_type": "1", "activity_code": "U01", "award_amount": 249366, "is_active": true, "project_num_split": {"appl_type_code": "1", "activity_code": "U01", "ic_code": "FD", "serial_num": "008130", "support_year": "01", "full_support_year": "01", "suffix_code": ""}, "principal_investigators": [{"profile_id": 79118887, "first_name": "Marc", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Aafjes", "is_contact_pi": true, "full_name": "Marc  Aafjes", "title": ""}, {"profile_id": 1896871, "first_name": "JEFFREY", "middle_name": "F", "last_name": "COHN", "is_contact_pi": false, "full_name": "JEFFREY F COHN", "title": "CHIEF SCIENTIST"}], "contact_pi_name": "AAFJES, MARC ", "program_officers": [{"first_name": "YORK", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "TOMITA", "full_name": "YORK  TOMITA"}], "agency_ic_admin": {"code": "FD", "abbreviation": "FDA", "name": "Food and Drug Administration"}, "agency_ic_fundings": [{"fy": 2024, "code": "FD", "name": "Food and Drug Administration", "abbreviation": "FDA", "total_cost": 249366.0, "direct_cost_ic": 235992.0, "indirect_cost_ic": 13374.0}], "cong_dist": "NY-12", "spending_categories": null, "project_start_date": "2024-02-20T00:00:00", "project_end_date": "2026-01-19T00:00:00", "organization_type": {"name": "Domestic For-Profits", "code": "FP", "is_other": false}, "geo_lat_lon": {"lon": -73.953301, "lat": 40.802311}, "opportunity_number": "PAR-21-178", "full_study_section": {"srg_code": "ZFD1", "srg_flex": null, "sra_designator_code": "CDER", "sra_flex_code": "S", "group_code": "12", "name": "Special Emphasis Panel[ZFD1 CDER-S (12)]"}, "award_notice_date": "2024-02-20T00:00:00", "is_new": false, "mechanism_code_dc": "RP", "core_project_num": "U01FD008130", "terms": null, "pref_terms": null, "abstract_text": "The broad long-term objective of this project is to improve the success rate of novel mood\ndisorder therapeutics by enhancing the reliability and generalizability of Clinician Reported\nOutcomes (ClinROs) in clinical trials.

understanding of the interactions between sperm and egg proteins, and the evolutionary forces driving reproductive protein evolution. The work employs the abalone system, which provides one of the most extensively studied sperm-egg interaction systems and which is amenable to biochemical and experimental studies difficult in other taxa. Two specific aims are proposed: (1) identify and characterize the egg plasma-membrane bound receptor of the abalone sperm protein sp18; and (2) characterize polymorphism and divergence of a candidate sp18 receptor already identified (ZPD) within and among abalone species, and test for co-evolution with sp18. Specific Aim 1 utilizes biochemical approaches (immunoprecipitation and affinity columns) and mass spectrometry to identify proteins from fractionated egg components which bind with high specificity to sp18. This work will test for evidence of direct functional interactions between sp18 and egg molecules. Specific Aim 2 examines polymorphism at a candidate sp18 receptor locus (ZPD) identified in genomic screens for egg coat proteins, as well as divergence at this locus among California abalone species. Patterns of polymorphism and sequence divergence for ZPD will be tested for evidence of positive selection as well as coevolution with sp18. Because these signatures are predicted for the sp18 receptor, they provide an independent and parallel means of distinguishing among candidate egg receptors (including ZPD and any others which may be identified under Specific Aim 1). Together these research aims represent a significant advancement in our understanding of the molecular interactions between sperm and egg, and contribute to a broader understanding of reproductive biology including human reproduction.   \r\n  \r\nThe interactions between sperm and egg molecules during fertilization have proven elusive in studies of human reproduction. The model organism used in this study (abalone, a marine gastropod) shares a common molecular basis with vertebrates (including humans and other mammals), exhibits a common pattern of rapid divergence of sperm and egg proteins, and allows for experimental approaches not possible in other animals. Thus the proposed work addresses general themes in reproductive biology, and may shed light on the molecular basis of sperm and egg interactions of relevance to human reproduction.   \r\n    \r\n\r\n", "project_title": "Evolution of Abalone Egg Coat Proteins", "phr_text": null, "spending_categories_desc": null, "agency_code": "NIH", "covid_response": null, "arra_funded": "N", "budget_start": "2007-05-01T00:00:00", "budget_end": "2008-04-30T00:00:00", "cfda_code": "93.864", "funding_mechanism": "Training, Individual", "direct_cost_amt": 49646, "indirect_cost_amt": null, "project_detail_url": "https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/7276423", "date_added": "2011-03-09T00:00:00"}, {"appl_id": 7420776, "subproject_id": "0346", "fiscal_year": 2006, "project_num": "2P41RR011823-11", "project_serial_num": "RR011823", "organization": {"org_name": "UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON", "city": null, "country": null, "org_city": "SEATTLE", "org_country": "UNITED STATES", "org_state": "WA", "org_state_name": null, "dept_type": "BIOCHEMISTRY", "fips_country_code": null, "org_duns": ["605799469"], "org_ueis": ["HD1WMN6945W6"], "primary_duns": "605799469", "primary_uei": "HD1WMN6945W6", "org_fips": "US", "org_ipf_code": "9087701", "org_zipcode": "981959472", "external_org_id": 9087701}, "award_type": "2", "activity_code": "P41", "award_amount": 5990, "is_active": false, "project_num_split": {"appl_type_code": "2", "activity_code": "P41", "ic_code": "RR", "serial_num": "011823", "support_year": "11", "full_support_year": "11", "suffix_code": ""}, "principal_investigators": [{"profile_id": 7983622, "first_name": "Jan", "middle_name": "E", "last_name": "Aagaard", "is_contact_pi": true, "full_name": "Jan E Aagaard", "title": ""}], "contact_pi_name": "AAGAARD, JAN E", "program_officers": [], "agency_ic_admin": {"code": "RR", "abbreviation": "NCRR", "name": "National Center for Research Resources"}, "agency_ic_fundings": [{"fy": 2006, "code": "RR", "name": "National Center for Research Resources", "abbreviation": "NCRR", "total_cost": 5990.0, "direct_cost_ic": 4345.0, "indirect_cost_ic": 1645.0}], "cong_dist": "WA-07", "spending_categories": null, "project_start_date": "2006-09-20T00:00:00", "project_end_date": "2007-08-31T00:00:00", "organization_type": {"name": "SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE", "code": "10", "is_other": false}, "geo_lat_lon": {"lon": -122.315168, "lat": 47.660307}, "opportunity_number": null, "full_study_section": {"srg_code": "ZRG1", "srg_flex": null, "sra_designator_code": "CB", "sra_flex_code": "H", "group_code": "40", "name": "Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-H(40)P]"}, "award_notice_date": "2006-09-18T00:00:00", "is_new": false, "mechanism_code_dc": "RC", "core_project_num": "P41RR011823", "terms": "<Gastropoda><evolution><protein>", "pref_terms": "Gastropoda;evolution;proteins", "abstract_text": " This subproject is one of many research subprojects utilizing the resources provided by a Center grant funded by NIH/NCRR.

The institution listed is for the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator. Proteins harboring a zona pellucida (ZP) domain are prominent components of vertebrate egg coats. Although less well characterized, the egg coat of the invertebrate marine gastropod abalone (Haliotis spp.) is also known to contain a ZP domain protein, raising the possibility of a common molecular basis of metazoan egg coat structures. Egg coat proteins from vertebrate as well as invertebrate taxa have been shown to evolve under positive selection. Studied most extensively in the abalone system, coevolution between adaptively diverging egg coat and sperm proteins may contribute to the rapid development of reproductive isolation. Thus identifying the pattern of evolution among egg coat proteins is important in understanding the role these genes may play in the speciation process. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the constituent proteins of the egg coat (vitelline envelope, VE) of abalone eggs, and to provide preliminary evidence regarding how selection has acted on VE proteins during abalone evolution.

exceeding the quantities of\nhuman cells by at least 10-fold, and the collective genome (the “metagenome”) exceeds our human genome\nin terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. We and others have recently demonstrated that bacteria are\ndetected in the placenta using a variety of culturable and non-culturable approaches. For several years we\nhave developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the placental microbiome, and observed\nvariation in its community membership and their function by virtue of gestational age at delivery. However, it\nremains unknown what the different maternal source(s) are of the placental microbiome, and whether it sinks\nto the fetus via the intra-amniotic cavity and thus is measureable in amniotic fluid.\n In response to the Human Placental Project, we propose to identify the sources and sinks for and of the\nplacental microbiome employing two large, robust and well characterized existing datasets. We will generate\nunparalleled metagenomics and metabolomics data, in order to test our central hypothesis that the placenta is\npopulated by commensal microbiota which largely arise from the maternal oral and GI communities, with a\nlesser contribution from the vagina. We further hypothesize that placental microbes populate the fetus and the\nintrauterine environment, and are detectable in mid-trimester amniotic fluid. Moreover, their metabolites serve\nas lasting signatures of the microbiotas functional presence.\n In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims in a total of over 1230 subjects\nsamples from two existing data sets. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first identify the\nmaternal source of the placental microbiota, and validate these findings using state of the art single molecule\nfluorescent in situ hybridization and culturation. We will thereafter recapitulate these findings in early and mid-\nsecond trimester amniotic fluid and thus identify the early evidence of the placental microbiota sink. In a final\naim, we will use LC/MS full spectral metabolomics on these same subjects samples to identify the stable and\nlasting metabolic footprint of the microbiome. We present our proof of concept work on intrahepatic cholestasis\nof pregnancy as evidence for the feasibility, significance and ready translational application of our approach.\n As a proven team of perinatal physician scientists with an emphasis and history of being at the forefront of\nbig data (and notably metagenomics) science, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of\nthese unique data sets in studies which are feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high\nimpact.", "project_title": "Source of the Placental Microbiome", "phr_text": "This application from a proven team with a history of being at the forefront of perinatal metagenomics, we are\nuniquely poised to now identify the maternal source and intrauterine sink of the placental microbiome.\nDeciphering these processes will provide insights into the role of microbiota, particularly commensal\nmicrobes, in human pregnancies.

growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable\ndisease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and\ndevelopment are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we\ngenerated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal\n(re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of\nnot only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current\nrenewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.\n Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model,\nwe were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring\nmicrobial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the\nearly human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their\nfunction by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains\nunknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is\ndriven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.\n Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that\nunder conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and\nhypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications.\nThese modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as\ntranscriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these\noffspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams\nonto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis,\nwe will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be\nto first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full\nspectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of\nmaternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics\ndata, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and\noffspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits.

Data from our laboratory and others collectively suggest that this occurs with reprogramming of gene expression via epigenetic changes to the 'histone code'. What constitutes the 'histone code'? While almost all cells of an individual bear near identical genomic constitutions, phenotype is ultimately determined by the gene expression profile. Gene expression is maintained by two major mechanisms: (1) transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers, and (2) epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation and core-histone modifications. Research is rapidly demonstrating the importance of the epigenetic code to normal human development as well as the burden of disease that occurs when the epigenetic code or machinery malfunctions. However, it remains a fundamental question in the field of epigenomics research if and how the fetal epigenome varies in response to maternal phenotype and diet modifications, and if it is truly predictive of later in life disease states (suh as obesity and diabetes). Our lab is dedicated to studying the effects of the in utero milieu on epigenetic changes in the fetus. We have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the fetal histone code. We have shown that it is maternal high fat diet consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which results in abnormal development of both the hypothalamic neurocircuitry and peripheral entrainment integral to regulation of fetal glucose and lipid homeostasis; these alterations are accompanied by epigenetic changes in chromatin structure resulting in reprogramming of fetal gene expression. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply concomitantly developed high throughput sequencing technologies with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome is modified. In this proposal we present our application of these technologies (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and custom CpG arrays) in our genome wide characterization of the fetal primate hepatic epigenome. Our studies are relevant to public health since they will clarify how the maternal diet influences the developing primate infant, and whether these changes increase the risk of later in life obesity.   \r\n   \r\nPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time.

communities. Human-associated microorganisms (the \"microbiome\") are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of human cells by at least 10-fold beginning in the neonatal period The collective genome (the \"metagenome\") exceeds our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. With respect to microbiota and preterm birth, it has generally assumed that the majority of intrauterine infections originate in the lower genital tract, with microbiota ascending into the otherwise sterile intrauterine environment to infect the placenta (preterm birth), fetal membranes (chorioamnionitis), umbilical cord (funisitis), and the fetus (sepsis). However, we and others have recently demonstrated that (1) the vaginal and gut microbiome communities are distinctly structured in pregnancy, and (2) the placenta is in fact not sterile, but rather harbors a low-abundance microbiome which is likely acquired through hematogenous transmission of the oral microbiome. Based on our prior studies and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that a distinct and largely commensal resident microbiome in pregnancy renders risk for preterm birth. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims: Aim 1 will use 16S-based approaches with inferred metagenomics employing samples from at-risk gravidae enrolled at <20 weeks gestation to reveal distinct microbial communities which occur in association with preterm birth; Aims 2&3 will use whole-genome shotgun sequencing with integrated host genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics to build on our functional computational pipelines and enable species identification, microbial gene catalogues, metabolic reconstructions, and mechanisms and networks of susceptibility to preterm birth. In addition, we describe our concomitant efforts to build a community resource for future large-scale studies on host and microbe biomarkers acquired in this set of preterm, near term, and term births. By utilizing our state-of-the-science technology and analysis tools in a longitudinal case-cohort of preterm birth subjects, we will be able to transform \"discovery based\" metagenomics and multi'omics science into readily translatable mechanistic studies at a previously unparalleled level. Our proven abilit to execute such clinical studies and utilize high-throughput technologies makes such large-scale \"team science\" feasible. Because preterm birth is prevalent in both the developed and developing world, these studies are of broad significance to our population's disease burden and will lead to potential innovative interventions.   \n   \n", "project_title": "A Multi'omics Approach towards Deciphering the Influence of the Microbiome on Pre", "phr_text": "PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application from a leading team of microbiome physician and nurse scientists at Baylor College of Medicine and UTMB aims to test the hypothesis that robust characterization of the microbiome in pregnancy will reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms and markers of preterm birth.

Our proven ability to conduct cutting-edge human microbiome research makes such large-scale studies feasible.

Data from our laboratory and others collectively suggest that this occurs with reprogramming of gene expression via epigenetic changes to the 'histone code'. What constitutes the 'histone code'? While almost all cells of an individual bear near identical genomic constitutions, phenotype is ultimately determined by the gene expression profile. Gene expression is maintained by two major mechanisms: (1) transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers, and (2) epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation and core-histone modifications. Research is rapidly demonstrating the importance of the epigenetic code to normal human development as well as the burden of disease that occurs when the epigenetic code or machinery malfunctions. However, it remains a fundamental question in the field of epigenomics research if and how the fetal epigenome varies in response to maternal phenotype and diet modifications, and if it is truly predictive of later in life disease states (suh as obesity and diabetes). Our lab is dedicated to studying the effects of the in utero milieu on epigenetic changes in the fetus. We have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the fetal histone code. We have shown that it is maternal high fat diet consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which results in abnormal development of both the hypothalamic neurocircuitry and peripheral entrainment integral to regulation of fetal glucose and lipid homeostasis; these alterations are accompanied by epigenetic changes in chromatin structure resulting in reprogramming of fetal gene expression. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply concomitantly developed high throughput sequencing technologies with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome is modified. In this proposal we present our application of these technologies (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and custom CpG arrays) in our genome wide characterization of the fetal primate hepatic epigenome. Our studies are relevant to public health since they will clarify how the maternal diet influences the developing primate infant, and whether these changes increase the risk of later in life obesity.   \n   \n", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": " Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time.

"abstract_text": "Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable\ndisease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and\ndevelopment are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we\ngenerated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal\n(re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of\nnot only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current\nrenewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.\n Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model,\nwe were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring\nmicrobial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the\nearly human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their\nfunction by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains\nunknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is\ndriven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.\n Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that\nunder conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and\nhypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications.\nThese modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as\ntranscriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these\noffspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams\nonto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis,\nwe will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be\nto first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full\nspectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of\nmaternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics\ndata, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and\noffspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and\nmolecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration\nof our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely\nlong-term significance and high translational impact.", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": "Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the\nroot molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure.\nIn the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than\nmaternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal\nhistone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and\nnote that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we\nare now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the\nmolecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and\nhow these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.", "spending_categories_desc": "Breastfeeding, Lactation and Breast Milk; Childhood

quantities of\nhuman cells by at least 10-fold, and the collective genome (the “metagenome”) exceeds our human genome\nin terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. We and others have recently demonstrated that bacteria are\ndetected in the placenta using a variety of culturable and non-culturable approaches. For several years we\nhave developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the placental microbiome, and observed\nvariation in its community membership and their function by virtue of gestational age at delivery. However, it\nremains unknown what the different maternal source(s) are of the placental microbiome, and whether it sinks\nto the fetus via the intra-amniotic cavity and thus is measureable in amniotic fluid.\n In response to the Human Placental Project, we propose to identify the sources and sinks for and of the\nplacental microbiome employing two large, robust and well characterized existing datasets. We will generate\nunparalleled metagenomics and metabolomics data, in order to test our central hypothesis that the placenta is\npopulated by commensal microbiota which largely arise from the maternal oral and GI communities, with a\nlesser contribution from the vagina. We further hypothesize that placental microbes populate the fetus and the\nintrauterine environment, and are detectable in mid-trimester amniotic fluid. Moreover, their metabolites serve\nas lasting signatures of the microbiotas functional presence.\n In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims in a total of over 1230 subjects\nsamples from two existing data sets. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first identify the\nmaternal source of the placental microbiota, and validate these findings using state of the art single molecule\nfluorescent in situ hybridization and culturation. We will thereafter recapitulate these findings in early and mid-\nsecond trimester amniotic fluid and thus identify the early evidence of the placental microbiota sink. In a final\naim, we will use LC/MS full spectral metabolomics on these same subjects samples to identify the stable and\nlasting metabolic footprint of the microbiome. We present our proof of concept work on intrahepatic cholestasis\nof pregnancy as evidence for the feasibility, significance and ready translational application of our approach.\n As a proven team of perinatal physician scientists with an emphasis and history of being at the forefront of\nbig data (and notably metagenomics) science, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of\nthese unique data sets in studies which are feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high\nimpact.", "project_title": "Source of the Placental Microbiome", "phr_text": "This application from a proven team with a history of being at the forefront of perinatal metagenomics, we are\nuniquely poised to now identify the maternal source and intrauterine sink of the placental microbiome.\nDeciphering these processes will provide insights into the role of microbiota, particularly commensal\nmicrobes, in human pregnancies.

Americans annually, and is currently in widespread perinatal (pre-pregnancy,\nduring pregnancy, and post-natal) clinical use. Over the past decade, clinical indications and pragmatic use of metformin\nhave steadily expanded beyond the treatment of overt diabetes outside of pregnancy, and now include prediabetes and\nobesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. With its expanded use, questions of\nunintended long-term harm have arisen. The rationale underlying these concerns for metformin exposure during\ndevelopment as a consequence of expanded maternal use arises from its basic pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of\naction, which we and others hypothesize converge to disrupt important metabolic pathways during fetal life, which are\nnecessary to establish normal birth weight and appropriate early post-natal growth trajectory. When combined with a\nmaternal Western-style diet (WSD), fetal metformin exposure leads to accelerated early development of a pre-diabetic,\npre-obese phenotype with evidence of obesity and insulin resistance in early adolescence (puberty onset).\n We are inspired by our preliminary data to pursue development of a non-human primate model of maternal\nmetformin use. Powered as a three-armed mechanistic-based clinical study, we will determine the impact of metformin\nor placebo exposure from pre-pregnancy through lactation on the development of obesity and insulin resistance. This\nstudy is adequately powered to test the hypothesis that maternal metformin use in isolation or in conjunction with a\nmaternal high fat diet renders low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, driving obesity and insulin resistance in\nthe offspring by onset of puberty (approximately 3-4 years of age). In Aim 1, we will determine if early life metformin\nexposure in control and/or WSD-fed dams leads to low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, resulting in obesity\nand insulin resistance in pubertal juvenile offspring. In Aim 2, we will determine what the impact of metformin exposure\nin WSD-fed dams is on maternal, fetal (G145) and juvenile (to puberty onset) metabolic physiology. This will include core\nmeasures of maternal and fetal organ metabolism (liver, muscle, gut and pancreas). In Aim 3, we will determine\nwhether weaning offspring onto a control diet can ameliorate or mitigate the effects of maternal metformin exposure in\nWSD-fed dams. Finally, in Aim 4 we will determine how early metformin exposure wields its molecular impact on control\nand WSD-induced alterations of core measures of maternal and fetal metabolism in the liver, gut, muscle, and pancreas.\n Considering the recently emerged epidemiologic evidence and known mechanisms of actions of metformin, there is\na rational concern that rather than preventing developmental programming, metformin use during pregnancy may\nhave unintended consequences of accelerating obesity and the metabolic syndrome epidemic in the next generation.\nThe animal, specimen, and uniformly generated multi’omic data generated in the current proposal will collectively\ninform ongoing clinical trials and future clinical implementation.", "project_title": "Metformin in Pregnancy: Fetal Consequences & Long-term Offspring Outcomes in a NHP Model", "phr_text": "Over the past decade, indications for the use of metformin have steadily expanded to now include not only overt\ndiabetes outside of pregnancy, but prediabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes (GDM), and\ntype 2 diabetes during pregnancy. With its expanded use, however, questions of unintended long-term harm to\noffspring exposed to metformin during gestation have arisen. The current proposal will generate a Rhesus macaque\nmodel and robust data necessary and sufficient to understand if, what, whether and how early life exposure to\nmetformin (with and without maternal

non-communicable\ndisease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and\ndevelopment are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we\ngenerated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal\n(re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of\nnot only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current\nrenewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.\n Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model,\nwe were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring\nmicrobial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the\nearly human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their\nfunction by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains\nunknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is\ndriven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.\n Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that\nunder conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and\nhypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications.\nThese modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as\ntranscriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these\noffspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams\nonto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis,\nwe will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be\nto first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full\nspectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of\nmaternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics\ndata, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and\noffspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and\nmolecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration\nof our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely\nlong-term significance and high translational impact.", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": "Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the\nroot molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure.\nIn the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than\nmaternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal\nhistone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and\nnote that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet.

Data from our laboratory and others collectively suggest that this occurs with reprogramming of gene expression via epigenetic changes to the 'histone code'. What constitutes the 'histone code'? While almost all cells of an individual bear near identical genomic constitutions, phenotype is ultimately determined by the gene expression profile. Gene expression is maintained by two major mechanisms: (1) transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers, and (2) epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation and core-histone modifications. Research is rapidly demonstrating the importance of the epigenetic code to normal human development as well as the burden of disease that occurs when the epigenetic code or machinery malfunctions. However, it remains a fundamental question in the field of epigenomics research if and how the fetal epigenome varies in response to maternal phenotype and diet modifications, and if it is truly predictive of later in life disease states (suh as obesity and diabetes). Our lab is dedicated to studying the effects of the in utero milieu on epigenetic changes in the fetus. We have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the fetal histone code. We have shown that it is maternal high fat diet consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which results in abnormal development of both the hypothalamic neurocircuitry and peripheral entrainment integral to regulation of fetal glucose and lipid homeostasis; these alterations are accompanied by epigenetic changes in chromatin structure resulting in reprogramming of fetal gene expression. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply concomitantly developed high throughput sequencing technologies with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome is modified. In this proposal we present our application of these technologies (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and custom CpG arrays) in our genome wide characterization of the fetal primate hepatic epigenome. Our studies are relevant to public health since they will clarify how the maternal diet influences the developing primate infant, and whether these changes increase the risk of later in life obesity.", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": "Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time.

childhood, including an increased susceptibility to\nanxiety. Epigenomic, metagenomic and metabolomic changes are likely key molecular mediators of these\nincreased risks. Our team has spent the past decade identifying and describing these molecular mediators\nwhich are associated with an adverse in utero environment, including the use of large scale multi’omics data\nsets to relate them to behavior in early childhood and adolescence.\n We have found that composite maternal and neonatal morbidities were increased after Harvey landfall\n(“Hurricane Harvey exposed”) compared with individuals who delivered before Harvey (“Harvey unexposed).\nThese adverse events were more common in pregnant women who answered positively to being directly\naffected by the hurricane, but did not vary by perceived stress. Thus, measures of stress and resilience\nfollowing hurricane exposure, and how this potentially affects neurobehavioral outcomes and resilience in the\nchildren of these pregnant women, had not yet been studied and is the goal of this current proposal.\n We are very excited about our capacity and readiness to conduct this study on an aggressive 1 year\ntimeline as outlined by our aims. We will leverage our existing and highly-characterized cohort of subjects who\nwere pregnant at the time of Hurricane Harvey. From these subjects we have already sequenced maternal\nsamples (placental, vaginal, oral, stool, and breastmilk) and infant specimens (stool and oral) for\nmetagenomics analyses. We propose to follow-up on the children of this cohort, to continue the metagenomic,\nmetabolomic and epigenomic studies afforded by the collection of these samples before, during and after\nHarvey. We propose to collect oral swabs and stool from these children, and perform behavioral and\nneuroimaging assessments at 4 years of age to determine the biologic signature of in utero exposure to\nHurricane Harvey and resultant neurobehavior with this exposure. By integrating exposure measures from our\nexisting, placental, neonatal and infant samples with accompanying robust clinical metadata, longitudinal\nmetagenomic, epigenomic and metabolomic data, then integrating behavioral and neurostructural imaging\ndata, we will be able inform and predict attributable risk. Having spent over a decade identifying both exposure\nrisks and molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental origins of disease, we are uniquely poised to\nrapidly expand and integrate this data in our post-Harvey setting in an ongoing cohort with studies which are\nscientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact.\nFollow-up of this existing cohort will provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community by making\navailable large scale data sets on 200 subjects which include metagenomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics\nand neurobehavioral data related to Hurricane Harvey.", "project_title": "Longitudinal Neural Imaging and Functional Resilience After Hurricane Harvey", "phr_text": "While the impact of the environmental exposures and increased levels of stress imparted by Hurricane Harvey\nis still being evaluated, we have found that composite maternal and neonatal morbidities were increased after\nHarvey landfall compared with individuals who delivered before Harvey.

chronic, non-communicable\ndisease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and\ndevelopment are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we\ngenerated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal\n(re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of\nnot only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current\nrenewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.\n Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model,\nwe were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring\nmicrobial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the\nearly human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their\nfunction by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains\nunknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is\ndriven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.\n Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that\nunder conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and\nhypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications.\nThese modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as\ntranscriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these\noffspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams\nonto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis,\nwe will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be\nto first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full\nspectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of\nmaternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics\ndata, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and\noffspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and\nmolecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration\nof our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely\nlong-term significance and high translational impact.", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": "Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the\nroot molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure.\nIn the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than\nmaternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal\nhistone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and\nnote that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we\nare now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the\nmolecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and\nhow these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.", "spending_categories_desc": "Breastfeeding, Lactation and Breast Milk; Childhood Obesity; Genetics; Human Genome; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Maternal Health; Microbiome; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Women's Health", "agency_code": "NIH", "covid_response": null, "arra_funded": "N", "budget_start": "2020-07-01T00:00:00", "budget_end": "2021-06-30T00:00:00", "cfda_code": "93.847", "funding_mechanism": "Non-SBIR/STTR", "direct_cost_amt": 429155, "indirect_cost_amt": 216808, "project_detail_url": "https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9991796", "date_added": "2020-07-18T19:38:12"}, {"appl_id": 9574710, "subproject_id": null, "fiscal_year": 2018, "project_num": "1R21ES029462-01", "project_serial_num": "ES029462", "organization": {"org_name": "BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE", "city": null, "country": null, "org_city": "HOUSTON", "org_country": "UNITED STATES", "org_state": "TX", "org_state_name": null, "dept_type": "OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY", "fips_country_code": null, "org_duns": ["051113330"], "org_ueis": ["FXKMA43NTV21"], "primary_duns": "051113330", "primary_uei": "FXKMA43NTV21", "org_fips": "US", "org_ipf_code": "481201", "org_zipcode": "770303411", "external_org_id": 481201}, "award_type": "1", "activity_code": "R21", "award_amount": 233070, "is_active": false, "project_num_split": {"appl_type_code": "1", "activity_code": "R21", "ic_code": "ES", "serial_num": "029462", "support_year": "01", "full_support_year": "01", "suffix_code": ""}, "principal_investigators": [{"profile_id": 8196581, "first_name": "Kjersti", "middle_name": "Marie", "last_name": "Aagaard", "is_contact_pi": true, "full_name": "Kjersti Marie Aagaard", "title": "PROFESSOR"}], "contact_pi_name": "AAGAARD, KJERSTI MARIE", "program_officers": [{"first_name": "ANIKA", "middle_name": "LIN", "last_name": "DZIERLENGA", "full_name": "ANIKA LIN DZIERLENGA"}], "agency_ic_admin": {"code": "ES", "abbreviation": "NIEHS", "name": "National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"}, "agency_ic_fundings": [{"fy": 2018, "code": "ES", "name": "National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences", "abbreviation": "NIEHS", "total_cost": 233070.0, "direct_cost_ic": 150000.0, "indirect_cost_ic": 83070.0}], "cong_dist": "TX-09", "spending_categories": [3932, 296, 176, 338, 3810, 679, 683, 689, 3920, 686], "project_start_date": "2018-07-01T00:00:00", "project_end_date": "2020-06-30T00:00:00", "organization_type": {"name": "SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE", "code": "10", "is_other": false}, "geo_lat_lon": {"lon": -95.400851, "lat": 29.70926}, "opportunity_number": "RFA-ES-16-005", "full_study_section": {"srg_code": "ZES1", "srg_flex": null, "sra_designator_code": "LAT", "sra_flex_code": "S", "group_code": "T3", "name": "Special Emphasis Panel[ZES1 LAT-S (T3)]"}, "award_notice_date": "2018-03-30T00:00:00", "is_new": false, "mechanism_code_dc": "RP", "core_project_num": "R21ES029462", "terms": "<1st trimester><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Bacteria><Birth><Breast Milk><Breastmilk><Clinical><Communities><Data><Data Collection><Development><Disasters><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Early Placental Phase><Elements><Environmental Exposure><Exposure to><Feces><First Pregnancy Trimester><First Trimester><Flooding><Floods><Frequencies><Functional Metagenomics><GI microbiome><Gestation><Health><Home><Home environment><Human><Human Milk><Human Mother's Milk><Hurricane><Impact evaluation><Infant><Infection><Infectious Pregnancy Complications><Infectious Skin Diseases><Ingestion><Inhalation><Inhaling><Life><Link><Long-term cohort><Longitudinal cohort><Longterm cohort><Mammary Gland Milk><Maternal Nutrition><Maternal diet><Measures><Mediator><Mediator of Activation><Mediator of activation protein><Metadata><Metagenomics><Microbe><Modern Man><Molecular><Monitor><Morbidity><Morbidity -

We have recently shown in humans\nand non-human primates that the placental and offspring gut microbiome community and metagenomic\nfunction are significantly altered with maternal antenatal (during pregnancy) infection and by the maternal diet.\nHowever, the response of the maternal and infant microbiome to highly stressful and microbial laden natural\ndisasters (such as flooding and large-scale population displacement such as recently occurred with Hurricane\nHarvey) has yet to be studied.\n Why study the built environmental alongside the maternal and infant microbiome and metabolome in\nresponse to Hurricane Harvey? Although it is now established that both microbial laden and anti-microbial\nexposures render an altered microbiome community in animal models, it is less clear whether this occurs in\nvivo. Our overarching hypothesis is that during a natural disaster environmental exposures (via inhalation,\nabsorption, and/or ingestion) to atypically encountered microbes (bacteria and fungi) and/or substances with\nantimicrobial properties will predictably alter the maternal and infant microbiomes. We will specifically test the\nhypothesis that exposures have a measureable effect only when an absent or dysbiotic/susceptible existing\nmicrobial community is present.\n We propose a series of innovative Aims whereby we will leverage 526 maternal-infant pairs from which\nmaternal samples (placental, vaginal, oral, stool, skin, breastmilk, and nasopharyngeal) and infant specimens\n(stool, oral, nasopharyngeal, skin) have been collected throughout gestation (first trimester to 8 weeks\npostpartum) “pre-Harvey” and compare to those collected “post-Harvey”. The combined impact of these\nstudies will be to gain mechanistic insight into the contribution of natural disaster environmental exposures on\nresilient or susceptible maternal and infant microbial communities and their functions, as well as their potential\ncontribution to morbidity, such as PTB and secondary skin and respiratory infections. By integrating exposure\nmeasures from our existing, multisite placental, maternal, and infant samples with accompanying robust clinical\nmetadata and existing and derived metagenomics and metabolomics data, we will be able inform and predict\nattributable risk. After having spent over a decade identifying both exposure risks and molecular mechanisms\nunderlying the developmental origins of disease, we are uniquely poised to rapidly expand and integrate built\nenvironment data in our post-Harvey setting in an ongoing cohort with studies which are scientifically rigorous,\nfeasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact.", "project_title": "Impact of Hurricane Harvey on the Maternal and Infant Microbiome and Birth Outcomes", "phr_text": "A key element to mitigating potential long term human health impact from natural disasters like Hurricane\nHarvey is understanding what is disrupted at a molecular level. Our group has previously shown that the\nmaternal, infant and placental microbiome and metagenomic functions are significantly altered with a number\nof exposures, and associated with increased risk of complications such as preterm birth (PTB). In the current\nproposal we will study 526 maternal-infant pairs from an ongoing preterm birth study (BaBs) to gain\nmechanistic insight into the contribution of natural disaster environmental

We and others have recently demonstrated that bacteria are\ndetected in the placenta using a variety of culturable and non-culturable approaches. For several years we\nhave developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the placental microbiome, and observed\nvariation in its community membership and their function by virtue of gestational age at delivery. However, it\nremains unknown what the different maternal source(s) are of the placental microbiome, and whether it sinks\nto the fetus via the intra-amniotic cavity and thus is measureable in amniotic fluid.\n In response to the Human Placental Project, we propose to identify the sources and sinks for and of the\nplacental microbiome employing two large, robust and well characterized existing datasets.

We further hypothesize that placental microbes populate the fetus and the\nintrauterine environment, and are detectable in mid-trimester amniotic fluid.

in fact co-evolved as highly plethoric communities. Human-associated microorganisms (the \"microbiome\") are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of human cells by at least 10-fold beginning in the neonatal period The collective genome (the \"metagenome\") exceeds our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. With respect to microbiota and preterm birth, it has generally assumed that the majority of intrauterine infections originate in the lower genital tract, with microbiota ascending into the otherwise sterile intrauterine environment to infect the placenta (preterm birth), fetal membranes (chorioamnionitis), umbilical cord (funisitis), and the fetus (sepsis). However, we and others have recently demonstrated that (1) the vaginal and gut microbiome communities are distinctly structured in pregnancy, and (2) the placenta is in fact not sterile, but rather harbors a low-abundance microbiome which is likely acquired through hematogenous transmission of the oral microbiome. Based on our prior studies and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that a distinct and largely commensal resident microbiome in pregnancy renders risk for preterm birth. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims: Aim 1 will use 16S-based approaches with inferred metagenomics employing samples from at-risk gravidae enrolled at <20 weeks gestation to reveal distinct microbial communities which occur in association with preterm birth; Aims 2&3 will use whole-genome shotgun sequencing with integrated host genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics to build on our functional computational pipelines and enable species identification, microbial gene catalogues, metabolic reconstructions, and mechanisms and networks of susceptibility to preterm birth. In addition, we describe our concomitant efforts to build a community resource for future large-scale studies on host and microbe biomarkers acquired in this set of preterm, near term, and term births. By utilizing our state-of-the-science technology and analysis tools in a longitudinal case-cohort of preterm birth subjects, we will be able to transform \"discovery based\" metagenomics and multi'omics science into readily translatable mechanistic studies at a previously unparalleled level. Our proven abilit to execute such clinical studies and utilize high-throughput technologies makes such large-scale \"team science\" feasible. Because preterm birth is prevalent in both the developed and developing world, these studies are of broad significance to our population's disease burden and will lead to potential innovative interventions.   \n   \n", "project_title": "A Multi'omics Approach towards Deciphering the Influence of the Microbiome on Pre", "phr_text": "PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application from a leading team of microbiome physician and nurse scientists at Baylor College of Medicine and UTMB aims to test the hypothesis that robust characterization of the microbiome in pregnancy will reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms and markers of preterm birth.

Data from our laboratory and others collectively suggest that this occurs with reprogramming of gene expression via epigenetic changes to the 'histone code'. What constitutes the 'histone code'? While almost all cells of an individual bear near identical genomic constitutions, phenotype is ultimately determined by the gene expression profile. Gene expression is maintained by two major mechanisms: (1) transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers, and (2) epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation and core-histone modifications. Research is rapidly demonstrating the importance of the epigenetic code to normal human development as well as the burden of disease that occurs when the epigenetic code or machinery malfunctions. However, it remains a fundamental question in the field of epigenomics research if and how the fetal epigenome varies in response to maternal phenotype and diet modifications, and if it is truly predictive of later in life disease states (suh as obesity and diabetes). Our lab is dedicated to studying the effects of the in utero milieu on epigenetic changes in the fetus. We have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the fetal histone code. We have shown that it is maternal high fat diet consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which results in abnormal development of both the hypothalamic neurocircuitry and peripheral entrainment integral to regulation of fetal glucose and lipid homeostasis; these alterations are accompanied by epigenetic changes in chromatin structure resulting in reprogramming of fetal gene expression. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply concomitantly developed high throughput sequencing technologies with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome is modified. In this proposal we present our application of these technologies (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and custom CpG arrays) in our genome wide characterization of the fetal primate hepatic epigenome. Our studies are relevant to public health since they will clarify how the maternal diet influences the developing primate infant, and whether these changes increase the risk of later in life obesity.   \n   \n", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": " Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time.

Obesity causes substantial social, economic and health burdens. The rate of obesity is escalating disproportionately in children (infants to young adults). This rapid increase is unlikely to be due to environment or genetics alone. Accumulating evidence from our laboratory and others suggests that adult\r\nmetabolic diseases originate in utero, and likely occur through the reprogramming of gene expression via epigenetic changes in chromatin structure (an altered \"histone code\"). Of interest, we have observed in a rodent transgenerational model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) that a diet supplemented with essential\r\nnutrients, yet unaltered in its caloric content, prevents adult metabolic disease and is associated with abrogation of reprogrammed gene expression. However, although such established models in rodents demonstrate that fetal alterations in the histone code are involved in the persistence and conveyance of the altered postnatal phenotype, little is known about the effects of maternal diet and resultant obesity on primate fetal biology. We hypothesized that a high fat diet in non-human primates would induce changes in hepatic chromatin structure resulting in altered expression of fetal genes critical to the development of childhood and adult obesity. Based on our preliminary data, the focus of this proposal is to apply developed high throughput\r\ntechnology (comparative epigenomics and metabolomics) to decipher the primate epigenome and metabolome in the obese maternal environment and then measure the impact of supplementation on the differentially altered epigenome and resultant disease. The novel innovation and significance resides within its potential to\r\nprovide (1) an expanded understanding of the mechanism through which a maternal high fat diet reprograms primate gene expression and (2) a simple intervention (essential nutrient supplementation with neither diet nor behavioral modification) with tremendous potential impact given the current obesity epidemic and the lack of efficacious therapeutics.", "project_title": "Characterization of the Fetal Primate Epigenome and Metabolome Under In Utero", "phr_text": "Overview. Early in my training, reigning thought described particulate inheritance and led to the notion that\nheredity was written in the language of DNA with the assumption that mutations in the nucleotide backbone\nallowed for the transmission of phenotypic traits and disease across generations. Although such teachings\nascribed DNA as being the entirety of our genetic inheritance, I was curious as to whether slight modifications\nto chromatin structure might regulate the accessibility of transcription factors. Emerging evidence in the\ndecades hence has led to our current understanding that the primary nucleotide sequence is but one aspect in\ndetermining the diversity of our genomic inheritance, with RNA interference and epigenetic modifications to\nDNA and chromatin structure playing contributory roles in providing stable alterations in gene expression. As a\nperinatologist, I have developed an inherent appreciation of the influence of the in utero environment on not\nonly fetal development but later adult health and disease. Hence the focus of my research has evolved to\naddress the earliest curiosities that led me into science then medicine: while genomic DNA may indeed be the\ntemplate of our heredity, is it not likely that the orchestration and regulation of its expression occurs primarily\nvia covalent modifications to chromatin structure? If so, is it not equally probable that in an aberrant gestational\nmilieu conserved epigenetic mechanisms are readily employed (and hence potentially reversible) during critical\nintervals in fetal developmental related to the establishment of the common adult metabolic morbidities?", "spending_categories_desc": "Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Perinatal Period -

Data from our laboratory and others collectively suggest that this occurs with reprogramming of gene expression via epigenetic changes to the 'histone code'. What constitutes the 'histone code'? While almost all cells of an individual bear near identical genomic constitutions, phenotype is ultimately determined by the gene expression profile. Gene expression is maintained by two major mechanisms: (1) transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers, and (2) epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation and core-histone modifications. Research is rapidly demonstrating the importance of the epigenetic code to normal human development as well as the burden of disease that occurs when the epigenetic code or machinery malfunctions. However, it remains a fundamental question in the field of epigenomics research if and how the fetal epigenome varies in response to maternal phenotype and diet modifications, and if it is truly predictive of later in life disease states (suh as obesity and diabetes). Our lab is dedicated to studying the effects of the in utero milieu on epigenetic changes in the fetus. We have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the fetal histone code. We have shown that it is maternal high fat diet consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which results in abnormal development of both the hypothalamic neurocircuitry and peripheral entrainment integral to regulation of fetal glucose and lipid homeostasis; these alterations are accompanied by epigenetic changes in chromatin structure resulting in reprogramming of fetal gene expression. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply concomitantly developed high throughput sequencing technologies with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome is modified. In this proposal we present our application of these technologies (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and custom CpG arrays) in our genome wide characterization of the fetal primate hepatic epigenome. Our studies are relevant to public health since they will clarify how the maternal diet influences the developing primate infant, and whether these changes increase the risk of later in life obesity.   \n   \n", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": " Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time.

10-fold, and the collective genome (the “metagenome”) exceeds our human genome\nin terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. We and others have recently demonstrated that bacteria are\ndetected in the placenta using a variety of culturable and non-culturable approaches. For several years we\nhave developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the placental microbiome, and observed\nvariation in its community membership and their function by virtue of gestational age at delivery. However, it\nremains unknown what the different maternal source(s) are of the placental microbiome, and whether it sinks\nto the fetus via the intra-amniotic cavity and thus is measureable in amniotic fluid.\n In response to the Human Placental Project, we propose to identify the sources and sinks for and of the\nplacental microbiome employing two large, robust and well characterized existing datasets. We will generate\nunparalleled metagenomics and metabolomics data, in order to test our central hypothesis that the placenta is\npopulated by commensal microbiota which largely arise from the maternal oral and GI communities, with a\nlesser contribution from the vagina. We further hypothesize that placental microbes populate the fetus and the\nintrauterine environment, and are detectable in mid-trimester amniotic fluid. Moreover, their metabolites serve\nas lasting signatures of the microbiotas functional presence.\n In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims in a total of over 1230 subjects\nsamples from two existing data sets. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first identify the\nmaternal source of the placental microbiota, and validate these findings using state of the art single molecule\nfluorescent in situ hybridization and culturation. We will thereafter recapitulate these findings in early and mid-\nsecond trimester amniotic fluid and thus identify the early evidence of the placental microbiota sink. In a final\naim, we will use LC/MS full spectral metabolomics on these same subjects samples to identify the stable and\nlasting metabolic footprint of the microbiome. We present our proof of concept work on intrahepatic cholestasis\nof pregnancy as evidence for the feasibility, significance and ready translational application of our approach.\n As a proven team of perinatal physician scientists with an emphasis and history of being at the forefront of\nbig data (and notably metagenomics) science, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of\nthese unique data sets in studies which are feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high\nimpact.", "project_title": "Source of the Placental Microbiome", "phr_text": "This application from a proven team with a history of being at the forefront of perinatal metagenomics, we are\nuniquely poised to now identify the maternal source and intrauterine sink of the placental microbiome.\nDeciphering these processes will provide insights into the role of microbiota, particularly commensal\nmicrobes, in human pregnancies.

widespread perinatal (pre-pregnancy,\nduring pregnancy, and post-natal) clinical use. Over the past decade, clinical indications and pragmatic use of metformin\nhave steadily expanded beyond the treatment of overt diabetes outside of pregnancy, and now include prediabetes and\nobesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. With its expanded use, questions of\nunintended long-term harm have arisen. The rationale underlying these concerns for metformin exposure during\ndevelopment as a consequence of expanded maternal use arises from its basic pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of\naction, which we and others hypothesize converge to disrupt important metabolic pathways during fetal life, which are\nnecessary to establish normal birth weight and appropriate early post-natal growth trajectory. When combined with a\nmaternal Western-style diet (WSD), fetal metformin exposure leads to accelerated early development of a pre-diabetic,\npre-obese phenotype with evidence of obesity and insulin resistance in early adolescence (puberty onset).\n We are inspired by our preliminary data to pursue development of a non-human primate model of maternal\nmetformin use. Powered as a three-armed mechanistic-based clinical study, we will determine the impact of metformin\nor placebo exposure from pre-pregnancy through lactation on the development of obesity and insulin resistance. This\nstudy is adequately powered to test the hypothesis that maternal metformin use in isolation or in conjunction with a\nmaternal high fat diet renders low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, driving obesity and insulin resistance in\nthe offspring by onset of puberty (approximately 3-4 years of age). In Aim 1, we will determine if early life metformin\nexposure in control and/or WSD-fed dams leads to low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, resulting in obesity\nand insulin resistance in pubertal juvenile offspring. In Aim 2, we will determine what the impact of metformin exposure\nin WSD-fed dams is on maternal, fetal (G145) and juvenile (to puberty onset) metabolic physiology. This will include core\nmeasures of maternal and fetal organ metabolism (liver, muscle, gut and pancreas). In Aim 3, we will determine\nwhether weaning offspring onto a control diet can ameliorate or mitigate the effects of maternal metformin exposure in\nWSD-fed dams. Finally, in Aim 4 we will determine how early metformin exposure wields its molecular impact on control\nand WSD-induced alterations of core measures of maternal and fetal metabolism in the liver, gut, muscle, and pancreas.\n Considering the recently emerged epidemiologic evidence and known mechanisms of actions of metformin, there is\na rational concern that rather than preventing developmental programming, metformin use during pregnancy may\nhave unintended consequences of accelerating obesity and the metabolic syndrome epidemic in the next generation.\nThe animal, specimen, and uniformly generated multi’omic data generated in the current proposal will collectively\ninform ongoing clinical trials and future clinical implementation.", "project_title": "Metformin in Pregnancy: Fetal Consequences & Long-term Offspring Outcomes in a NHP Model", "phr_text": "Over the past decade, indications for the use of metformin have steadily expanded to now include not only overt\ndiabetes outside of pregnancy, but prediabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes (GDM), and\ntype 2 diabetes during pregnancy. With its expanded use, however, questions of unintended long-term harm to\noffspring exposed to metformin during gestation have arisen. The current proposal will generate a Rhesus macaque\nmodel and robust data necessary and sufficient to understand if, what, whether and how early life exposure to\nmetformin (with and without maternal & post-weaning Western style diet feeding) renders offspring persistently\nsusceptible to obesity and insulin resistance.", "spending_categories_desc": "Breastfeeding, Lactation and Breast Milk; Childhood Obesity; Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Perinatal Period -

Data from our laboratory and others collectively suggest that this occurs with reprogramming of gene expression via epigenetic changes to the 'histone code'. What constitutes the 'histone code'? While almost all cells of an individual bear near identical genomic constitutions, phenotype is ultimately determined by the gene expression profile. Gene expression is maintained by two major mechanisms: (1) transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers, and (2) epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation and core-histone modifications. Research is rapidly demonstrating the importance of the epigenetic code to normal human development as well as the burden of disease that occurs when the epigenetic code or machinery malfunctions. However, it remains a fundamental question in the field of epigenomics research if and how the fetal epigenome varies in response to maternal phenotype and diet modifications, and if it is truly predictive of later in life disease states (suh as obesity and diabetes). Our lab is dedicated to studying the effects of the in utero milieu on epigenetic changes in the fetus. We have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the fetal histone code. We have shown that it is maternal high fat diet consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which results in abnormal development of both the hypothalamic neurocircuitry and peripheral entrainment integral to regulation of fetal glucose and lipid homeostasis; these alterations are accompanied by epigenetic changes in chromatin structure resulting in reprogramming of fetal gene expression. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply concomitantly developed high throughput sequencing technologies with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome is modified. In this proposal we present our application of these technologies (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and custom CpG arrays) in our genome wide characterization of the fetal primate hepatic epigenome. Our studies are relevant to public health since they will clarify how the maternal diet influences the developing primate infant, and whether these changes increase the risk of later in life obesity.", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": "Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time.

During the initial grant period, we\ngenerated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal\n(re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of\nnot only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current\nrenewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.\n Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model,\nwe were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring\nmicrobial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the\nearly human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their\nfunction by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains\nunknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is\ndriven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.\n Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that\nunder conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and\nhypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications.\nThese modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as\ntranscriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these\noffspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams\nonto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis,\nwe will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be\nto first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full\nspectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of\nmaternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics\ndata, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and\noffspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and\nmolecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration\nof our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely\nlong-term significance and high translational impact.", "project_title": "Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity", "phr_text": "Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the\nroot molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure.\nIn the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than\nmaternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal\nhistone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and\nnote that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet.

widespread perinatal (pre-pregnancy,\nduring pregnancy, and post-natal) clinical use. Over the past decade, clinical indications and pragmatic use of metformin\nhave steadily expanded beyond the treatment of overt diabetes outside of pregnancy, and now include prediabetes and\nobesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. With its expanded use, questions of\nunintended long-term harm have arisen. The rationale underlying these concerns for metformin exposure during\ndevelopment as a consequence of expanded maternal use arises from its basic pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of\naction, which we and others hypothesize converge to disrupt important metabolic pathways during fetal life, which are\nnecessary to establish normal birth weight and appropriate early post-natal growth trajectory. When combined with a\nmaternal Western-style diet (WSD), fetal metformin exposure leads to accelerated early development of a pre-diabetic,\npre-obese phenotype with evidence of obesity and insulin resistance in early adolescence (puberty onset).\n We are inspired by our preliminary data to pursue development of a non-human primate model of maternal\nmetformin use. Powered as a three-armed mechanistic-based clinical study, we will determine the impact of metformin\nor placebo exposure from pre-pregnancy through lactation on the development of obesity and insulin resistance. This\nstudy is adequately powered to test the hypothesis that maternal metformin use in isolation or in conjunction with a\nmaternal high fat diet renders low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, driving obesity and insulin resistance in\nthe offspring by onset of puberty (approximately 3-4 years of age). In Aim 1, we will determine if early life metformin\nexposure in control and/or WSD-fed dams leads to low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, resulting in obesity\nand insulin resistance in pubertal juvenile offspring. In Aim 2, we will determine what the impact of metformin exposure\nin WSD-fed dams is on maternal, fetal (G145) and juvenile (to puberty onset) metabolic physiology. This will include core\nmeasures of maternal and fetal organ metabolism (liver, muscle, gut and pancreas). In Aim 3, we will determine\nwhether weaning offspring onto a control diet can ameliorate or mitigate the effects of maternal metformin exposure in\nWSD-fed dams. Finally, in Aim 4 we will determine how early metformin exposure wields its molecular impact on control\nand WSD-induced alterations of core measures of maternal and fetal metabolism in the liver, gut, muscle, and pancreas.\n Considering the recently emerged epidemiologic evidence and known mechanisms of actions of metformin, there is\na rational concern that rather than preventing developmental programming, metformin use during pregnancy may\nhave unintended consequences of accelerating obesity and the metabolic syndrome epidemic in the next generation.\nThe animal, specimen, and uniformly generated multi’omic data generated in the current proposal will collectively\ninform ongoing clinical trials and future clinical implementation.", "project_title": "Metformin in Pregnancy: Fetal Consequences & Long-term Offspring Outcomes in a NHP Model", "phr_text": "Over the past decade, indications for the use of metformin have steadily expanded to now include not only overt\ndiabetes outside of pregnancy, but prediabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes (GDM), and\ntype 2 diabetes during pregnancy.

The current proposal will generate a Rhesus macaque\nmodel and robust data necessary and sufficient to understand if, what, whether and how early life exposure to\nmetformin (with and without maternal

communities. Human-associated microorganisms (the \"microbiome\") are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of human cells by at least 10-fold beginning in the neonatal period The collective genome (the \"metagenome\") exceeds our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. With respect to microbiota and preterm birth, it has generally assumed that the majority of intrauterine infections originate in the lower genital tract, with microbiota ascending into the otherwise sterile intrauterine environment to infect the placenta (preterm birth), fetal membranes (chorioamnionitis), umbilical cord (funisitis), and the fetus (sepsis). However, we and others have recently demonstrated that (1) the vaginal and gut microbiome communities are distinctly structured in pregnancy, and (2) the placenta is in fact not sterile, but rather harbors a low-abundance microbiome which is likely acquired through hematogenous transmission of the oral microbiome. Based on our prior studies and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that a distinct and largely commensal resident microbiome in pregnancy renders risk for preterm birth. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims: Aim 1 will use 16S-based approaches with inferred metagenomics employing samples from at-risk gravidae enrolled at <20 weeks gestation to reveal distinct microbial communities which occur in association with preterm birth; Aims 2&3 will use whole-genome shotgun sequencing with integrated host genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics to build on our functional computational pipelines and enable species identification, microbial gene catalogues, metabolic reconstructions, and mechanisms and networks of susceptibility to preterm birth. In addition, we describe our concomitant efforts to build a community resource for future large-scale studies on host and microbe biomarkers acquired in this set of preterm, near term, and term births. By utilizing our state-of-the-science technology and analysis tools in a longitudinal case-cohort of preterm birth subjects, we will be able to transform \"discovery based\" metagenomics and multi'omics science into readily translatable mechanistic studies at a previously unparalleled level. Our proven abilit to execute such clinical studies and utilize high-throughput technologies makes such large-scale \"team science\" feasible. Because preterm birth is prevalent in both the developed and developing world, these studies are of broad significance to our population's disease burden and will lead to potential innovative interventions.   \n   \n", "project_title": "A Multi'omics Approach towards Deciphering the Influence of the Microbiome on Pre", "phr_text": "PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application from a leading team of microbiome physician and nurse scientists at Baylor College of Medicine and UTMB aims to test the hypothesis that robust characterization of the microbiome in pregnancy will reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms and markers of preterm birth.

We have recently shown in humans\nand non-human primates that the placental and offspring gut microbiome community and metagenomic\nfunction are significantly altered with maternal antenatal (during pregnancy) infection and by the maternal diet.\nHowever, the response of the maternal and infant microbiome to highly stressful and microbial laden natural\ndisasters (such as flooding and large-scale population displacement such as recently occurred with Hurricane\nHarvey) has yet to be studied.\n Why study the built environmental alongside the maternal and infant microbiome and metabolome in\nresponse to Hurricane Harvey? Although it is now established that both microbial laden and anti-microbial\nexposures render an altered microbiome community in animal models, it is less clear whether this occurs in\nvivo. Our overarching hypothesis is that during a natural disaster environmental exposures (via inhalation,\nabsorption, and/or ingestion) to atypically encountered microbes (bacteria and fungi) and/or substances with\nantimicrobial properties will predictably alter the maternal and infant microbiomes. We will specifically test the\nhypothesis that exposures have a measureable effect only when an absent or dysbiotic/susceptible existing\nmicrobial community is present.\n We propose a series of innovative Aims whereby we will leverage 526 maternal-infant pairs from which\nmaternal samples (placental, vaginal, oral, stool, skin, breastmilk, and nasopharyngeal) and infant specimens\n(stool, oral, nasopharyngeal, skin) have been collected throughout gestation (first trimester to 8 weeks\npostpartum) “pre-Harvey” and compare to those collected “post-Harvey”. The combined impact of these\nstudies will be to gain mechanistic insight into the contribution of natural disaster environmental exposures on\nresilient or susceptible maternal and infant microbial communities and their functions, as well as their potential\ncontribution to morbidity, such as PTB and secondary skin and respiratory infections. By integrating exposure\nmeasures from our existing, multisite placental, maternal, and infant samples with accompanying robust clinical\nmetadata and existing and derived metagenomics and metabolomics data, we will be able inform and predict\nattributable risk. After having spent over a decade identifying both exposure risks and molecular mechanisms\nunderlying the developmental origins of disease, we are uniquely poised to rapidly expand and integrate built\nenvironment data in our post-Harvey setting in an ongoing cohort with studies which are scientifically rigorous,\nfeasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact.", "project_title": "Impact of Hurricane Harvey on the Maternal and Infant Microbiome and Birth Outcomes", "phr_text": "A key element to mitigating potential long term human health impact from natural disasters like Hurricane\nHarvey is understanding what is disrupted at a molecular level. Our group has previously shown that the\nmaternal, infant and placental microbiome and metagenomic functions are significantly altered with a number\nof exposures, and associated with increased risk of complications such as preterm birth (PTB). In the current\nproposal we will study 526 maternal-infant pairs from an ongoing preterm birth study (BaBs) to gain\nmechanistic insight into the contribution of natural disaster environmental exposures on the microbiome and\nmetabolome and their potential contribution PTB and secondary skin and respiratory infections.", "spending_categories_desc": "Breastfeeding, Lactation and Breast Milk; Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions; Clinical Research; Infectious Diseases; Maternal Health; Microbiome; Pediatric; Perinatal Period -

Obesity causes substantial social, economic and health burdens. The rate of obesity is\nescalating disproportionately in children (infants to young adults). This rapid increase is unlikely to be due to\nenvironment or genetics alone. Accumulating evidence from our laboratory and others suggests that adult\nmetabolic diseases originate in utero, and likely occur through the reprogramming of gene expression via\nepigenetic changes in chromatin structure (an altered \"histone code\"). Of interest, we have observed in a\nrodent transgenerational model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) that a diet supplemented with essential\nnutrients, yet unaltered in its caloric content, prevents adult metabolic disease and is associated with\nabrogation of reprogrammed gene expression. However, although such established models in rodents\ndemonstrate that fetal alterations in the histone code are involved in the persistence and conveyance of the\naltered postnatal phenotype, little is known about the effects of maternal diet and resultant obesity on primate\nfetal biology. We hypothesized that a high fat diet in non-human primates would induce changes in hepatic\nchromatin structure resulting in altered expression of fetal genes critical to the development of childhood and\nadult obesity. Based on our preliminary data, the focus of this proposal is to apply developed high throughput\ntechnology (comparative epigenomics and metabolomics) to decipher the primate epigenome and metabolome\nin the obese maternal environment and then measure the impact of supplementation on the differentially\naltered epigenome and resultant disease. The novel innovation and significance resides within its potential to\nprovide (1) an expanded understanding of the mechanism through which a maternal high fat diet reprograms\nprimate gene expression and (2) a simple intervention (essential nutrient supplementation with neither diet nor\nbehavioral modification) with tremendous potential impact given the current obesity epidemic and the lack of\nefficacious therapeutics.", "project_title": "Characterization of the Fetal Primate Epigenome and Metabolome Under In Utero", "phr_text": "Overview. Early in my training, reigning thought described particulate inheritance and led to the notion that\nheredity was written in the language of DNA with the assumption that mutations in the nucleotide backbone\nallowed for the transmission of phenotypic traits and disease across generations. Although such teachings\nascribed DNA as being the entirety of our genetic inheritance, I was curious as to whether slight modifications\nto chromatin structure might regulate the accessibility of transcription factors. Emerging evidence in the\ndecades hence has led to our current understanding that the primary nucleotide sequence is but one aspect in\ndetermining the diversity of our genomic inheritance, with RNA interference and epigenetic modifications to\nDNA and chromatin structure playing contributory roles in providing stable alterations in gene expression. As a\nperinatologist, I have developed an inherent appreciation of the influence of the in utero environment on not\nonly fetal development but later adult health and disease. Hence the focus of my research has evolved to\naddress the earliest curiosities that led me into science then medicine: while genomic DNA may indeed be the\ntemplate of our heredity, is it not likely that the orchestration and regulation of its expression occurs primarily\nvia covalent modifications to chromatin structure? If so, is it not equally probable that in an aberrant gestational\nmilieu conserved epigenetic mechanisms are readily employed (and hence potentially reversible) during critical\nintervals in fetal developmental related to the establishment of the common adult metabolic morbidities?", "spending_categories_desc": null, "agency_code": "NIH", "covid_response": null, "arra_funded": "N",

Scientist Career Development Award to train Dr. Vinay Kumar Aakalu. The primary goal of this application is to serve as a basis for training Dr. Aakalu in the critical skills necessary to deveop into an independent scientific investigator focused on lacrimal cell and precursor cell biology. The specific aims of the proposed educational program are the performance of 1) graduate level cell, molecular, stem cell biology and basic translational/clinical trial course work at the University of Illinois at Chicago 2) basic scientific investigations in accessory lacrimal cell and\nstem cell biology under the guidance of an experienced four person mentoring committee 3) seminar and conference participation at the University of Illinois and outside the University of Illinois. The mentoring committee is made up of experts in stem cell, ocular, molecular cell biology and translational research. Each mentor is well experienced in training clinician- scientists. The mentoring committee will be focused on guiding Dr. Aakalu in the development of research skills, analytical thinking and the ethical performance of basic and translational research. The overarching research goals of the proposal are to develop a better understanding of accessory lacrimal cell biology and to identify and isolate precursor cells from this tissue. Th specific aims of the project are to: 1. Develop a better understanding of ALG distribution, growth requirements, and changes with patient characteristics. 1a. A three dimensional map of the cadaveric human orbit will be constructed to determine the location of ALG tissue throughout the ocular surface as a basis for rational harvesting decisions. 1b. Characterize ALG tissue in human surgical specimens and relate the robustness or histopathologic changes in these tissues to relevant patient characteristics (age, gender, race, hormonal status). 1c. Develop ALG cultures from human surgical specimens to better understand requirements for cell survival and expansion. 2. Establish the presence of precursor cells in ALG tissue and isolate and characterize these precursor cells. 2a. Identify precursor marker positive ALG cells and determine a signature marker pattern using human specimens and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. 2b. Isolate precursor candidate cells utilizing fluorescence cell sorting and determine if changes in precursor candidate cell populations are noted with different patient characteristics. 2c. Determine if precursor candidate cells isolated have stem cell properties. 2d.\nEstablish cultures from precursor candidates and determine if these cultures can produce functional ALG cells.", "project_title": "Study of Accessory Lacrimal Gland and Precursor Cell Biology", "phr_text": "PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of accessory lacrimal gland (tear producing gland) cell biology and identification of stem cells in these tissues will provide a basi for developing treatments and transplantation efforts for patients with severe dry eye disease and eye surface diseases.", "spending_categories_desc": "Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human", "agency_code": "NIH", "covid_response": null, "arra_funded": "N", "budget_start": "2017-04-01T00:00:00", "budget_end": "2018-03-31T00:00:00", "cfda_code": "93.867", "funding_mechanism": "Other Research-Related", "direct_cost_amt": 218914, "indirect_cost_amt": 17513, "project_detail_url": "https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9262226", "date_added": "2017-05-27T20:43:50"}, {"appl_id": 11170459, "subproject_id": "8632", "fiscal_year": 2025, "project_num": "5P30EY001792-46", "project_serial_num": "EY001792", "organization": {"org_name": "UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO", "city": null, "country": null, "org_city": "Chicago", "org_country": "UNITED STATES", "org_state": "IL", "org_state_name": null, "dept_type": null, "fips_country_code": null, "org_duns": ["098987217"], "org_ueis": ["W8XEAJDKMXH3"], "primary_duns": "098987217", "primary_uei": "W8XEAJDKMXH3", "org_fips": "US", "org_ipf_code": "577703", "org_zipcode": "606124305", "external_org_id": 577703}, "award_type": "5", "activity_code": "P30", "award_amount": 183746, "is_active": true, "project_num_split": {"appl_type_code": "5", "activity_code": "P30", "ic_code": "EY", "serial_num": "001792", "support_year": "46", "full_support_year": "46", "suffix_code": ""}, "principal_investigators": [{"profile_id": 7018046, "first_name": "Vinay", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Aakalu", "is_contact_pi": true, "full_name": "Vinay  Aakalu", "title": ""}], "contact_pi_name": "AAKALU, VINAY ", "program_officers": [], "agency_ic_admin": {"code": "EY", "abbreviation": "NEI", "name": "National Eye Institute"}, "agency_ic_fundings": [{"fy": 2025, "code": "EY", "name": "National Eye Institute", "abbreviation": "NEI", "total_cost": 183746.0, "direct_cost_ic": 114913.0, "indirect_cost_ic": 68833.0}], "cong_dist": "IL-07", "spending_categories": null, "project_start_date": "1997-09-01T00:00:00", "project_end_date": "2026-08-31T00:00:00", "organization_type": {"name": "Domestic Higher Education", "code": "10", "is_other": true}, "geo_lat_lon": {"lon": -87.667721, "lat": 41.871509}, "opportunity_number": "PAR-20-051", "full_study_section": {"srg_code": "ZEY1", "srg_flex": null, "sra_designator_code": "VSN", "sra_flex_code": null, "group_code": null, "name": "ZEY1-VSN"}, "award_notice_date": "2025-08-04T00:00:00", "is_new": false, "mechanism_code_dc": "RC", "core_project_num": "P30EY001792", "terms": "<Body Tissues><Cell Body><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Line><CellLine><Cells><Cellular biology><Cloning><Core Grant><Cultured Cells><DNA><DNA Molecular Biology><DNA seq><DNA sequencing><DNAseq><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Equipment><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Goals><Histologic><Histologically><Histology><Individual><Investigators><MicroRNAs><Molecular Biology><Morphology><Organ Culture><Organ Culture Techniques><Progenitor Cells><Protein Analysis><Proteomics><Research><Research Personnel><Research Specimen><Researchers><Services><Specimen><Strains Cell Lines><Time><Tissues><Transfection><Viral Packaging><Viral Vector><Virus Packagings><Vision research><cell biology><cell culture><cell cultures><cost><cultured cell line><design><designing><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flow cytophotometry><in vitro Organ Culturing><in vitro vertebrate organ culturing><instrument><instrumentation><laser capture microdissection><miRNA><skills><stem cells><virology>", "pref_terms": "Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cells;Cellular biology;Cloning;Core Grant;Cultured Cells;DNA;DNA sequencing;Equipment;Flow Cytometry;Goals;Histologic;Histology;Individual;MicroRNAs;Molecular Biology;Morphology;Organ Culture Techniques;Protein Analysis;Proteomics;Research;Research Personnel;Services;Specimen;Time;Tissues;Transfection;Viral Packaging;Viral Vector;Vision research;cost;design;experimental study;instrument;instrumentation;laser capture microdissection;skills;stem cells;virology", "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY: CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY CORE\nThe Cellular and Molecular Biology Core provides essential equipment and support for molecular biology, cell\nculture, histology, and virology.

Commonly used ophthalmic preservatives can cause a toxic epitheliopathy that\nresults in OSD. The treatment of these diseases is primarily through the use of palliative measures. Great\nopportunity exists to improve the quality of life of many patients by developing novel treatments. DED and OSD\nare associated with significant dysfunction of corneal epithelia and inflammatory changes on the ocular surface.\nMany of these changes are induced by hyperosmolarity, desiccation and inflammatory insults. Histatin is a family\nof peptides found primarily in saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-infective properties.\nLittle data exist on the mechanisms of action of histatin peptides, though some effects are thought to be\nmediated through as yet unknown receptors. We have found that these peptides can reduce inflammatory\nchanges associated with exposures of toxic preservatives to the ocular surface and in experimental conditions\nthat mimic DED. We have also found a potential novel ligand-receptor interaction for histatin peptides. Our long\nterm objective is to develop a new class of DED and OSD therapeutics which are non-toxic and anti-\ninflammatory. Our central hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the inflammatory effects of toxic\nand inflammatory insults to corneal epithelia in vitro and in vivo. We will utilize well vetted models of toxic\nepitheliopathy, hyperosmolarity and desiccation in order to show the efficacy of histatin peptides in treating\nOSDs. We will also undertake studies to find receptors for histatin peptide. The proposed research is innovative\nas it is the first study to investigate the use of histatin peptides in the treatment of DED and OSD.

Vinay Kumar\nAakalu. The primary goal of this application is to serve as a basis for training Dr. Aakalu in the critical skills\nnecessary to develop into an independent scientific investigator focused on lacrimal cell and precursor cell\nbiology. The specific aims of the proposed educational program are the performance of 1) graduate level cell,\nmolecular, stem cell biology and basic translational/clinical trial course work at the University of Illinois at\nChicago 2) basic scientific investigations in accessory lacrimal cell and stem cell biology under the guidance of\nan experienced four person mentoring committee 3) seminar and conference participation at the University of\nIllinois and outside the University of Illinois. The mentoring committee is made up of experts in stem cell,\nocular, molecular cell biology and translational research. Each mentor is well experienced in training clinician-\nscientists. The mentoring committee will be focused on guiding Dr. Aakalu in the development of research\nskills, analytical thinking and the ethical performance of basic and translational research. The overarching\nresearch goals of the proposal are to develop a better understanding of accessory lacrimal cell biology and to\nidentify and isolate precursor cells from this tissue. The specific aims of the project are to: 1. Develop a\nbetter understanding of ALG distribution, growth requirements, and changes with patient characteristics. 1a. A\nthree dimensional map of the cadaveric human orbit will be constructed to determine the location of ALG\ntissue throughout the ocular surface as a basis for rational harvesting decisions. 1b. Characterize ALG tissue in\nhuman surgical specimens and relate the robustness or histopathologic changes in these tissues to relevant\npatient characteristics (age, gender, race, hormonal status). 1c. Develop ALG cultures from human surgical\nspecimens to better understand requirements for cell survival and expansion. 2. Establish the presence of\nprecursor cells in ALG tissue and isolate and characterize these precursor cells. 2a. Identify precursor marker\npositive ALG cells and determine a signature marker pattern using human specimens and\nimmunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. 2b. Isolate precursor candidate cells utilizing fluorescence cell\nsorting and determine if changes in precursor candidate cell populations are noted with different patient\ncharacteristics. 2c. Determine if precursor candidate cells isolated have stem cell properties. 2d. Establish\ncultures from precursor candidates and determine if these cultures can produce functional ALG cells.", "project_title": "Study of Accessory Lacrimal Gland and Precursor Cell Biology",

"abstract_text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort and adversely affect visual quality and\nquality of life. Many subtypes of DED are associated with ocular surface inflammation. Inflammation of the\nocular surface is mediated by both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Inflammation in DED can be\nassociated with ocular pain. Mixed DED (MDE) is characterized by decreased tear production (aqueous\ndeficient) and greater evaporation of the tear film (evaporative dry eye). MDE is often present in later stages\nof DED. DED amongst Veterans is common, and can be associated with a more severe symptom burden than\ncivilians. Veterans are at risk for developing MDE due to high rates of multiple medication use and co-morbid\nconditions, like glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Current treatment options are\nlimited and primarily palliative. Great opportunity exists to improve the quality of life of Veterans by\ndeveloping novel treatments for inflammation in DED. An area of the immune system that has been\nunderstudied and under-targeted by therapeutics in DED is the innate immune system. In particular Toll-like\nreceptor (TLR) signaling pathways may be over-active in DED. Histatin is a family of peptides found primarily\nin saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-bacterial properties. Little data exist on the\nmechanisms of action of histatin peptides. We have found that histatin peptides can improve the health of the\nocular surface under experimental conditions that mimic DED. Our long term objective is to develop a new\nclass of DED therapeutics that target the innate immune system to reduce ocular surface inflammation. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the damaging effects of an overactive innate\nimmune signaling in DED. We will utilize a well vetted model of MDE in order to show the efficacy of histatin\npeptides in treating DED. We will also undertake mechanistic studies to find the critical mediators of histatin\npeptide effects on innate immune pathways in ocular epithelia. The proposed research is innovative as it is the\nfirst study to investigate the use of histatin peptides as a treatment for innate immune over-activity in MDE.\nWe believe the results of these studies will yield significant progress in the development of new therapeutics\nthrough the use of rigorous and well defined methods and metrics in clinically relevant translational models of\ndisease.", "project_title": "Novel Treatments for Modulation of Innate Immunity in Veteran Related Eye Diseases", "phr_text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort, poor quality of vision and worsened\nquality of life. DED is more common among patients using multiple medications, including glaucoma\nmedications, and in patients with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. DED is more\ncommon among older people and women. As Veterans age and there are increasing numbers of female\nVeterans, DED has become increasingly important for VA to address. Moreover, Veterans with DED have risk\nfactors for worse outcomes and can have more severe symptoms than the general population. Many types of\nDED are associated with ocular surface inflammation and over-activity of the immune system, including\ncomponents of the innate immune system. This project will demonstrate the utility of histatin peptides as a\ntreatment for DED, and their ability to decrease damaging elements of the innate immune system. The results\nof this project will enhance healthcare for Veterans by creating a novel class of treatments for DED.", "spending_categories_desc": null, "agency_code": "VA", "covid_response": null,

other ocular surface diseases (OSD) are common conditions that can reduce visual\nfunction and quality of life. Commonly used ophthalmic preservatives can cause a toxic epitheliopathy that\nresults in OSD. The treatment of these diseases is primarily through the use of palliative measures. Great\nopportunity exists to improve the quality of life of many patients by developing novel treatments. DED and OSD\nare associated with significant dysfunction of corneal epithelia and inflammatory changes on the ocular surface.\nMany of these changes are induced by hyperosmolarity, desiccation and inflammatory insults. Histatin is a family\nof peptides found primarily in saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-infective properties.\nLittle data exist on the mechanisms of action of histatin peptides, though some effects are thought to be\nmediated through as yet unknown receptors. We have found that these peptides can reduce inflammatory\nchanges associated with exposures of toxic preservatives to the ocular surface and in experimental conditions\nthat mimic DED. We have also found a potential novel ligand-receptor interaction for histatin peptides. Our long\nterm objective is to develop a new class of DED and OSD therapeutics which are non-toxic and anti-\ninflammatory. Our central hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the inflammatory effects of toxic\nand inflammatory insults to corneal epithelia in vitro and in vivo. We will utilize well vetted models of toxic\nepitheliopathy, hyperosmolarity and desiccation in order to show the efficacy of histatin peptides in treating\nOSDs. We will also undertake studies to find receptors for histatin peptide. The proposed research is innovative\nas it is the first study to investigate the use of histatin peptides in the treatment of DED and OSD. These studies\nare significant because they will advance the development of new therapeutics through the use of rigorous and\nwell defined methods in clinically relevant translational models of disease and validate a novel receptor-ligand\nrelationship.", "project_title": "Novel Treatments for Ocular Surface Diseases", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nOcular surface diseases, inflammation and dry eye diseases are common problems that reduce quality of life\nand vision.

and\nquality of life. Many subtypes of DED are associated with ocular surface inflammation. Inflammation of the\nocular surface is mediated by both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Inflammation in DED can be\nassociated with ocular pain. Mixed DED (MDE) is characterized by decreased tear production (aqueous\ndeficient) and greater evaporation of the tear film (evaporative dry eye). MDE is often present in later stages\nof DED. DED amongst Veterans is common, and can be associated with a more severe symptom burden than\ncivilians. Veterans are at risk for developing MDE due to high rates of multiple medication use and co-morbid\nconditions, like glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Current treatment options are\nlimited and primarily palliative. Great opportunity exists to improve the quality of life of Veterans by\ndeveloping novel treatments for inflammation in DED. An area of the immune system that has been\nunderstudied and under-targeted by therapeutics in DED is the innate immune system. In particular Toll-like\nreceptor (TLR) signaling pathways may be over-active in DED. Histatin is a family of peptides found primarily\nin saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-bacterial properties. Little data exist on the\nmechanisms of action of histatin peptides. We have found that histatin peptides can improve the health of the\nocular surface under experimental conditions that mimic DED. Our long term objective is to develop a new\nclass of DED therapeutics that target the innate immune system to reduce ocular surface inflammation. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the damaging effects of an overactive innate\nimmune signaling in DED. We will utilize a well vetted model of MDE in order to show the efficacy of histatin\npeptides in treating DED. We will also undertake mechanistic studies to find the critical mediators of histatin\npeptide effects on innate immune pathways in ocular epithelia. The proposed research is innovative as it is the\nfirst study to investigate the use of histatin peptides as a treatment for innate immune over-activity in MDE.\nWe believe the results of these studies will yield significant progress in the development of new therapeutics\nthrough the use of rigorous and well defined methods and metrics in clinically relevant translational models of\ndisease.", "project_title": "Novel Treatments for Modulation of Innate Immunity in Veteran Related Eye Diseases", "phr_text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort, poor quality of vision and worsened\nquality of life.

disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort and adversely affect visual quality and\nquality of life. Many subtypes of DED are associated with ocular surface inflammation. Inflammation of the\nocular surface is mediated by both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Inflammation in DED can be\nassociated with ocular pain. Mixed DED (MDE) is characterized by decreased tear production (aqueous\ndeficient) and greater evaporation of the tear film (evaporative dry eye). MDE is often present in later stages\nof DED. DED amongst Veterans is common, and can be associated with a more severe symptom burden than\ncivilians. Veterans are at risk for developing MDE due to high rates of multiple medication use and co-morbid\nconditions, like glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Current treatment options are\nlimited and primarily palliative. Great opportunity exists to improve the quality of life of Veterans by\ndeveloping novel treatments for inflammation in DED. An area of the immune system that has been\nunderstudied and under-targeted by therapeutics in DED is the innate immune system. In particular Toll-like\nreceptor (TLR) signaling pathways may be over-active in DED. Histatin is a family of peptides found primarily\nin saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-bacterial properties. Little data exist on the\nmechanisms of action of histatin peptides. We have found that histatin peptides can improve the health of the\nocular surface under experimental conditions that mimic DED. Our long term objective is to develop a new\nclass of DED therapeutics that target the innate immune system to reduce ocular surface inflammation. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the damaging effects of an overactive innate\nimmune signaling in DED. We will utilize a well vetted model of MDE in order to show the efficacy of histatin\npeptides in treating DED. We will also undertake mechanistic studies to find the critical mediators of histatin\npeptide effects on innate immune pathways in ocular epithelia. The proposed research is innovative as it is the\nfirst study to investigate the use of histatin peptides as a treatment for innate immune over-activity in MDE.\nWe believe the results of these studies will yield significant progress in the development of new therapeutics\nthrough the use of rigorous and well defined methods and metrics in clinically relevant translational models of\ndisease.", "project_title": "Novel Treatments for Modulation of Innate Immunity in Veteran Related Eye Diseases", "phr_text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort, poor quality of vision and worsened\nquality of life. DED is more common among patients using multiple medications, including glaucoma\nmedications, and in patients with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Moreover, Veterans with DED have risk\nfactors for worse outcomes and can have more severe symptoms than the general population. Many types of\nDED are associated with ocular surface inflammation and over-activity of the immune system, including\ncomponents of the innate immune system.

other ocular surface diseases (OSD) are common conditions that can reduce visual\nfunction and quality of life. Commonly used ophthalmic preservatives can cause a toxic epitheliopathy that\nresults in OSD. The treatment of these diseases is primarily through the use of palliative measures. Great\nopportunity exists to improve the quality of life of many patients by developing novel treatments.

of life. Commonly used ophthalmic preservatives can cause a toxic epitheliopathy that\nresults in OSD. The treatment of these diseases is primarily through the use of palliative measures. Great\nopportunity exists to improve the quality of life of many patients by developing novel treatments. DED and OSD\nare associated with significant dysfunction of corneal epithelia and inflammatory changes on the ocular surface.\nMany of these changes are induced by hyperosmolarity, desiccation and inflammatory insults. Histatin is a family\nof peptides found primarily in saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-infective properties.\nLittle data exist on the mechanisms of action of histatin peptides, though some effects are thought to be\nmediated through as yet unknown receptors. We have found that these peptides can reduce inflammatory\nchanges associated with exposures of toxic preservatives to the ocular surface and in experimental conditions\nthat mimic DED. We have also found a potential novel ligand-receptor interaction for histatin peptides. Our long\nterm objective is to develop a new class of DED and OSD therapeutics which are non-toxic and anti-\ninflammatory. Our central hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the inflammatory effects of toxic\nand inflammatory insults to corneal epithelia in vitro and in vivo. We will utilize well vetted models of toxic\nepitheliopathy, hyperosmolarity and desiccation in order to show the efficacy of histatin peptides in treating\nOSDs. We will also undertake studies to find receptors for histatin peptide. The proposed research is innovative\nas it is the first study to investigate the use of histatin peptides in the treatment of DED and OSD. These studies\nare significant because they will advance the development of new therapeutics through the use of rigorous and\nwell defined methods in clinically relevant translational models of disease and validate a novel receptor-ligand\nrelationship.", "project_title": "Novel Treatments for Ocular Surface Diseases", "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nOcular surface diseases, inflammation and dry eye diseases are common problems that reduce quality of life\nand vision.

In particular Toll-like\nreceptor (TLR) signaling pathways may be over-active in DED. Histatin is a family of peptides found primarily\nin saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-bacterial properties. Little data exist on the\nmechanisms of action of histatin peptides. We have found that histatin peptides can improve the health of the\nocular surface under experimental conditions that mimic DED. Our long term objective is to develop a new\nclass of DED therapeutics that target the innate immune system to reduce ocular surface inflammation. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the damaging effects of an overactive innate\nimmune signaling in DED. We will utilize a well vetted model of MDE in order to show the efficacy of histatin\npeptides in treating DED. We will also undertake mechanistic studies to find the critical mediators of histatin\npeptide effects on innate immune pathways in ocular epithelia. The proposed research is innovative as it is the\nfirst study to investigate the use of histatin peptides as a treatment for innate immune over-activity in MDE.\nWe believe the results of these studies will yield significant progress in the development of new therapeutics\nthrough the use of rigorous and well defined methods and metrics in clinically relevant translational models of\ndisease.", "project_title": "Novel Treatments for Modulation of Innate Immunity in Veteran Related Eye Diseases", "phr_text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that can cause discomfort, poor quality of vision and worsened\nquality of life. DED is more common among patients using multiple medications, including glaucoma\nmedications, and in patients with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. DED is more\ncommon among older people and women. As Veterans age and there are increasing numbers of female\nVeterans, DED has become increasingly important for VA to address. Moreover, Veterans with DED have risk\nfactors for worse outcomes and can have more severe symptoms than the general population. Many types of\nDED are associated with ocular surface inflammation and over-activity of the immune system, including\ncomponents of the innate immune system.

visual\nfunction and quality of life. Commonly used ophthalmic preservatives can cause a toxic epitheliopathy that\nresults in OSD. The treatment of these diseases is primarily through the use of palliative measures. Great\nopportunity exists to improve the quality of life of many patients by developing novel treatments. DED and OSD\nare associated with significant dysfunction of corneal epithelia and inflammatory changes on the ocular surface.\nMany of these changes are induced by hyperosmolarity, desiccation and inflammatory insults. Histatin is a family\nof peptides found primarily in saliva and is known to have significant wound healing and anti-infective properties.\nLittle data exist on the mechanisms of action of histatin peptides, though some effects are thought to be\nmediated through as yet unknown receptors. We have found that these peptides can reduce inflammatory\nchanges associated with exposures of toxic preservatives to the ocular surface and in experimental conditions\nthat mimic DED. We have also found a potential novel ligand-receptor interaction for histatin peptides. Our long\nterm objective is to develop a new class of DED and OSD therapeutics which are non-toxic and anti-\ninflammatory. Our central hypothesis is that histatin peptides can ameliorate the inflammatory effects of toxic\nand inflammatory insults to corneal epithelia in vitro and in vivo. We will utilize well vetted models of toxic\nepitheliopathy, hyperosmolarity and desiccation in order to show the efficacy of histatin peptides in treating\nOSDs. We will also undertake studies to find receptors for histatin peptide. The proposed research is innovative\nas it is the first study to investigate the use of histatin peptides in the treatment of DED and OSD.
